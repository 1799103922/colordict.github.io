An abbreviation of 一行三昧.A particle; the very least.'Single vehicle' (eka-ya^na). A term used to indicate the doctrine that there is only one teaching, which is the expedient means to attract people to the Single Buddha vehicle. Since this single vehicle teaching is the teaching of becoming a Buddha, it is also called the 'bodhisattva vehicle' 菩萨乘, the 'Buddha vehicle' 佛乘 and the Great Vehicle 大乘. The Faxiang 法相 school interprets this bodhisattva vehicle of the three vehicle 三乘 system as the 'one vehicle' or 'buddha vehicle.' According to Kuiji's 窥基 explanation, the ekaya^na teaching of the Faxiang school has two levels, 摄入大乘 and 出生大乘. The former is the expedient to attract people of undermined nature (不定性) to the Single Buddha vehicle. Because of the existence of sentient beings incapable of Buddhahood, this teaching does not fully correspond with the meaning of single vehicle. But since all members of the audience in the Lotus Sutra 法华经 have the potential to become Buddha, this teaching is true and effective in that situation. The latter means that all teachings of Buddha are 'born' from a single Maha^ya^na teaching. Kuiji says that this is the teaching of the S/ri^ma^la^-su^tra 胜□经 and the Nirvana Sutra 涅盘经. In Huayan 华严 and Tiantai 天台, there is a distinction between this one Buddha vehicle and the bodhisattva vehicle of the three vehicles.The Buddhist schools and thinkers that support the theory of the single vehicle: Huayan 华严宗, Tiantai 天台宗, Chan 禅宗, etc.The single vehicle teaching that expresses the nature.

Tantra of the Secret Meanings of the Names 秘密名仪轨, translated by Da^napa^la 施护 in 1009 CE. An explanatory continuation (akhya^natantra) of the Tattvasam!graha 真实摄经 (T 882). Most of the text comments on the significance of various yoga-related concepts (the four mudra^s 四印, procedures for sama^dhi, etc.) and the names of the Tattvasam!graha's 37 divinities. There is an ongoing polemic against conventional ethics and the performance of rites, which are seen as useless in the pursuit of liberation. Instead the text emphasizes radical mind-based methods, such as seeing lust, hatred and delusion (ra^ga, dve/sa, moha 贪嗔痴) as none other than tatha^gatas -- an approach which is standard for later Buddhist esotericism, particularly the Guhyasama^ja 秘密集会 (T 885). In this connection, there appears an infamous, oft-quoted passage which appears to advocate killing sentient beings, lying, stealing and adultery; Da^napa^la's version obfuscates this passage (T 888.18.538b13-14) and others completely, also bowdlerizing several terms concerning sexual yoga (eg. lin%ga is "joiner" 相者; bhaga is "destroyer" 破者). However, it is notable that the monk Ratna^kara/sa^nti also neuters this language in his commentary, the S/ri^sarvarahasyanibam!dho-rahah!pradi^po-na^ma (To.2623, P.3450); eg. one should kill the idea of sentient beings. For an Eng. tr. of this, the sole Indian commentary, along with the full text from Tib., see Wayman (1984); for an early Japanese study of the Tibetan version, see Togano^ (1953).

Chinese monk of the Tang dynasty, acknowledged as one of the eight patriarchs of the doctrine 傅授八祖 in Shingon lineages. He joined the priesthood after the sudden death of his parents in 704, having previously distinguished himself in Taoist circles. He studied Chan 禅 at Mount Son 嵩山 with the seventh patriarch of the northern school, Puji 普寂 (631-739), and studied Vinaya with Huizhen 惠真 (673-751), a disciple of Hongying 弘景. In addition, while on Mount Tendai 天台山 he studied mathematics and astronomy, complementing his widely-recognised expertise in Taoist divination and calendrical science. In 716, he became the disciple of S/ubha^karasim!h!a 善无畏, subsequently receiving a summons to the court of emperor Xuanzong 玄宗. He was also initiated into various esoteric practices by Vajrabodhi 金刚智 shortly after their first meeting in 720. His most accomplished work, a huge commentary 大日经疏 (T 1796) on the Vairocana^bhisam!bodhi 大日经, was completed in 725 CE. Yixing is also popularly remembered as the inventor of the armillary-driven clock.(1) A single body. A single person.

Ippen was born in present-day Ehime prefecture and studied at an early age with a disciple of Ho^nen 法然. He left the priesthood once to return to the secular world, but later reversed this decision. After a pilgrimage to Zenko^ji 善光寺 in Nagano prefecture, he went to a secluded temple in Ehime, where he carried out rigorous religious practice, and eventually had an experience of intimate unity with Amita^bha Buddha 阿弥陀佛. He became convinced through this experience that no matter what one's degree of religious preparation, he or she could be reborn in the Pure Land by virtue of even one recitation of Amita^bha's name. He subsequently wandered throughout the country, handing out slips of paper to people with basic instructions for his style of Pure Land practice. He is said to have converted thousands. Approaching death at the age of 51, he burned all of his own writings, and thus none of his works survive.Il-do ui; (Doctrine of the Single Path) by Wonhyo 元晓.(icchantika). A transliteration of the Sanskrit term icchantika. Also translated into Chinese as duanshangen 断善根 'one who has cut off the good roots' and xinbujuzu 信不具足 'lacking in the necessary faith.' A person whose roots of goodness are cut off and therefore cannot be saved. Someone who cannot attain enlightenment no matter how strenuously they practice. The term icchan originally refers to someone who is in a continual state of craving. In India the term refers to an Epicurean or a secularist. In Buddhism it refers to someone who lacks the basic causes and conditions for becoming a Buddha. The theory of the existence of such people was taught by the Yogacara school. Buddhist schools such as Tiantai 天台, Huayan 华严 etc., disagreed with this theory, teaching that all beings can become buddhas. This becomes the source of debate in later East Asian Buddhism, and is discussed at length in the "Buddha-nature Treatise" (佛性论).Also written 一圆教. The 'one-voice teaching.' The Buddha's teaching is unitary. A theory established by Bodhiruci 菩提流支 when he came to Changan in about 502 CE The reasons that there are teachings of small/great vehicle and teachings of emptiness/existence is due to the temperaments and capabilities of people."One Bright Pearl."

(4) The "three minds" of Yoga^ca^ra: the base mind (a^laya 阿赖耶, or eighth consciousness); the provisional base mind (manas 末那, or seventh consciousness) and the mind involved in worldly discriminations (mano 意 or sixth consciousness). 〔五家解说谊HPC 7.14c1-2〕(5) The three minds of progressive observation of the emptiness of self , emptiness of dharmas (objects), and emptiness of both at once, as taught in the Yoga^ca^rabhu^mi-/sa^stra. 〔瑜伽论 T 1579.30.605c19-24; 二障义 HPC 1.803a6-9〕(6) Desire, hatred and ignorance.The three natures. {I} The three natures of perception in Yoga^ca^ra: (1) The nature of existence produced from attachment to illusory discrimination. The mind of mistakenly assigning a real essence to those things that are produced from causes and conditions and have no true essence, and the appearance of that mistaken world (parikalpitah-svabha^va; bianji suoyixing 遍计所执性). (2) The nature of existence arising from causes and conditions. All existence is produced according to cause (paratantra-svabha^va; 依他起性; yitaqixing) . (3) The nature of existence being perfectly accomplished; the highest state of existence conforming to ultimate reality (parinispanna-svabha^va; yuanchengshi xing 圆成实性; ).〔成唯识论T 1585.31.45c〕{II} The division of all elemental constructs into three moral qualities: (1) That which produces goodness 善. (2) That which produces evil 恶 and (3) That which is neutral 无记, producing neither good nor evil. The neutral category is further subdivided into two categories of impedimentary neutrality 有覆无记 and non-impedimentary neutrality 无覆无记. The afflictions 烦恼 are included in the evil category.〔俱舍论、 T 1558.29.7b〕In the Faxiang sect 法相宗, the use of the three natures 三性 to explain the middle path 中道. According to Consciousness-only 唯识 theory, all dharmas 法 (all existences) are included in these three natures. The nature based on all-pervading discrimination is the dharma expressing the average man's deluded attachments. The existence that is based on accepting the fact that there are regular people is the nature of all-pervading discrimination, though it is not something that is real. This point is called "non being" or "emptiness." In Consciousness-only doctrine, emptiness means non-being, which is quite different from emptiness as understood in the Prajn~a^pa^ramita^ sutras, which understand emptiness to mean "that which is ungraspable and unattached." The next, in the nature of existence established according to causal arising, those things which are established according to causal arising are called "dharmas." This is "provisional existence" or "phenomena" (jiayou 假有). It is also called "non-empty." The nature of complete becoming is absolute reality. That is, the essence of existence. This is true existence, and therefore the three time divisions of the teaching (see sanshijiao 三时教) of existence, emptiness and the middle path, are understood as the middle path of going by the three natures, as distinct from a one-sided clinging to existence and a one-sided clinging to emptiness.Three Evil Paths  三恶道  They are the three lowest realms of the Nine Realms: hell, hungry ghost and animal.（地狱，饿鬼，畜牲）Three Delusions  三惑  In Tien Tai, three doubts in the mind of Bodhisattva, producing three delusions, i.e.,   1.through things seen and thought 2.through the immense variety of duties in saving humans 3.through ignorance
'Three delusions,'three afflictions.' (1) Three kinds of basic defilement: craving (tanyu 贪欲), anger (chenhui 嗔恚), and ignorance (yuchi 愚痴). These are equivalent to the 'three poisons' (sandu 三毒). (2) In Tiantai teaching 天台宗, the three delusions are: delusions arising from incorrect views and thoughts (jiansihuo 见思惑); delusions which hinder knowledge and are as numerous as the number of grains of sand in the Ganges river (chenshahuo 尘沙惑); and delusions which hinder knowledge of reality (wuminghuo 无明惑). The first type of delusion is dealt with by followers of Hi^naya^na 小乘 as well as Maha^ya^na 大乘. The latter two types are destroyed only by bodhisattvas.【参照: 三慧】 〔二障义 HPC 1.807a〕Three kinds of wisdom. 【参照: 闻思修】 〔庄严经论 T 1604.31.〕The three categories of self-restraint.

In contrast to the 'three natures' of 'attachment to pervasive imagination', 'dependent arising', and 'perfectly accomplished reality', these three non-natures are established from the point of view of the lack of self nature of elements. Thus, this is an explanation from the standpoint of emptiness. (1) 相无性xiangwuxing . Form, appearance, or seeing is unreal, e.g., a rope appearing like a snake. (2) 生无性shengwuxing .

The doctrinal division of the teachings of S/akyamuni's lifetime into three periods. The Faxiang sect's 法相宗 explanation establishes the three times of the teachings of existence, the teaching of emptiness, and the teaching of the middle way. (1) The teaching of the first period (the period of the teaching of existence), says that all existence is established due to causes, but the elements of this composition are truly existent. This is established in the a^gama sutras and other Hi^naya^na sutras. (2) The teaching of the second period, which says that the original nature of all things is empty. This is also called the "negative" period. This is the beginning of "great vehicle" teaching, as it is changing from "small vehicle" teaching. The prajn~a^pa^ramita^ sutras are examples of this teaching. (3) The teaching of the third period is that of true emptiness: the middle way is explained affirmatively through such sutras as the Avatam!saka and the Sam!dhinirmocana. This is also called the period of the "true great vehicle."(1) "Three awarenesses": The awareness of the causes and conditions remaining from prior lifetimes (which corrects the view of eternalism); the awareness of future affairs (which corrects the view of nihi^ism); uncontaminated awareness (which ends the creation of defiled views). (2) three kinds of wisdom among the six supernatural powers 六神通. (1) The power of divine vision 天眼通, wherein they can observe the full course of passage by sentient beings through the six destinies. (2) the power of the knowledge of previous lifetimes 宿命通，宿住通, whereby they know the events of countless kalpas of previous lifetimes experienced by themselves, as well as all the beings in the six destinies; (3) the power of the extinction of contamination 漏尽通, whereby they completely extinguish all the afflictions of the three realms, and thus are no longer subject to rebirth in the three realms.(sama^dhi). The term in Sanskrit means "putting together", "composing the mind", "intent contemplation", "perfect absorption."

These are associated with /sra^vakas, pratyekabuddhas and bodhisattvas, respectively. 〔四教仪注〕 (3) The wisdom attained by listening, the wisdom attained by thinking, and the wisdom attained by practice. 〔瑜伽论 T 1579.30.690a1〕 (4) The three kinds of wisdom taught in the Dazhidulun : the wisdom of the two vehicles, which understands the individual aspects of phenomena 一切智; the wisdom of the bodhisattva 道种智, which understands the total aspect of phenomena and the wisdom of the buddhas, which is perfectly enlightened in regard to every aspect of phenomena 一切种智. 〔大智度论 T 1509.25.〕Three Wisdom  三智（一切智、道种智、一切种智）  There are three kinds of wisdom:   1.Sravaka and Praetyka-Buddha knowledge that all the Dharmas or laws are void and unreal   2.Bodhisattva knowledge of all things in proper discrimination   3.Buddha knowledge or perfect knowledge of all things in their every aspect and relationship past, present and future.   In Tien Tai Sect, the Three Wisdom is associated with the Three Dogmas of Void, Unreal and Mean.(1) The three kinds of existence: those things which exist in the realm of desire, the realm of form, and the formless realm.

The Desire Realm (欲界 yujie) consists of twenty places. They are the four continents (四大洲 siduzho^u), the eight burning hells 八热地狱, and the six heavens of the desire realm 六欲天. Beyond the sixth desire realm heaven are the seventeen dhyana heavens of the form realm 色界十七天. Above the form realm heavens is the formless realm (wusejie 无色界), where there is no material existence.

Three observations taught in the Yingluo benye jing which were later elucidated by Chih-i 智□. These are (a) the view of emptiness (kongguan 空观), which negates mistaken notions of common-sense reality; (b) The view of dependent arising which cancels extreme attachment to emptiness, and (c) the middle view (zhongguan 中观) which utilizes either of the above but is not attached.

"Three Treatises." An appellation for three important /sa^stras which served as the foundational texts of a Chinese school which would be referred to by the same name--the "Three Treatise School 三论宗." These three texts are the Madhyamaka-/sa^stra (Zhong lun 中论) and the Dva^da/sanika^ya-/sa^stra (Shiermen lun 十二门论) by Na^ga^rjuna 龙树 and the S/ata-/sa^stra (Bai lun) 百论 by his disciple Aryadeva 提婆, all three of which were translated into Chinese by Kuma^raji^va 鸠摩罗什. The school made significant contributions in the area of the logic of emptiness. The Madhyamaka-/sa^stra taught the "eight negations" of neither arising nor ceasing 不生不灭 , neither eternal nor not eternal 不常不断, neither one nor many 不一不异 and neither coming nor going 不来不出. These were used to refute all forms of attachment to concepts of existence and non-existence, and thus the meaning of "middle path" 中道 wherein all things are accepted as existent, but as lacking in self-nature. The Dva^da/sanika^ya-/sa^stra also explains the emptiness of all dharmas in twelve sections, and the S/ata-/sa^stra explains emptiness to refute the arguments of non-Buddhist philosophers.             Kuma^raji^va passed these texts on to his students Daosheng 道生, Sengzhao 僧肇, and Seng-lang. The last of these distinguished the Sanlun school from the Satyasiddhi school and can thus is sometimes regarded as its actual founder. In the 6th century the most important representatives of this school were Falang and Jizang and under them the Sanlun school experienced a major upsurge. In the 7th century it was brought to Japan by Egwan, a Korean student of Jizang. After the appearance of the Faxiang 法相 school, the Sanlun school decreased in importance.The Sanlun zong, or Three-Treatise school.

The school was named as such because of its reliance on three Indian /sa^stras (【参照: 三论】above) which had formed the basis for the Indian Ma^dhyamika 中观派 doctrine, and therefore the Sanlun school is seen as the transmission of Ma^dhyamika thought in China. Although this school would eventually be phased out by native Chinese schools such as Tiantai 天台 and Huayan 华严, its rigorous explanations of the logic of emptiness and the middle way would be deeply assimilated into the doctrines of later schools. The Three-treatise school was transmitted to Korea as Samnon chong and to Japan as the Sanron shu^.The Profound Meaning of the Three Treatises, T 1852.45.1a-15a. By Jizang 吉藏.'three requests.' To ask (request) three times. In the sutras, the Buddha is often implored to teach three times before he speaks.Three Dogmas  三谛  They are the Dogma of Void, Unreal and Mean. 【参照: Three Meditations of One Mind】
'The triple truth,' or 'threefold truth' The Tiantai term used to explain reality in three aspects. (1) kongdi 空谛, the 'truth of emptiness', i.e., all existences are empty and non-substantial in essence. (2) jiadi 假谛, truth of temporariness, i.e., all existences are temporary manifestations produced by causes and conditions. (3) zhongdi 中谛,' truth of the mean', i.e., the absolute reality of all existences cannot be explained in either negative or affirmative terms.The observation of the real principle that allows one to be aware of the perfect interfusion of the three truths of voidness, temporariness and the mean simultaneously.'Three degrees of worthies' or 'Three Worthies.' (1) In Hi^naya^na Abhidharma, these are the three stages of wutingxinguan 五停心观, biexiangnianzhu 别相念住 and zongxiangnianzhu 总相念住. (2) In the Faxiang school, the thirty stages of 'ten abidings', 'ten practices', and 'ten dedications of merit.'(trika^ya). The 'three bodies' of the Buddha. (I) Dharmaka^ya, sambhogaka^ya, nirma^naka^ya. (1) The dharmaka^ya (fashen 法身) is a reference to the transcendence of form and realization of true thusness; (2) the sambhogaka^ya (baoshen 报身) is the buddha-body that is called 'reward body' or 'body of enjoyment of the merits attained as a bodhisattva'; (3) the nirma^naka^ya (huashen 化身, yingshen 应身) is the body manifested in response to the need to teach sentient beings. (II) In the Faxiang 法相 school the three bodies are explained in this way: (1) the Buddha body in its self-nature, which is the same as the dharma body; (2) the body which he receives for enjoyment shouyongshen 受用身. Within this is the body received for one's own enjoyment in the transformation into Great Reflecting Wisdom, and the body received for the enjoyment of others in the transformation into the Wisdom of Awareness of Equality. The first one is experienced only in the Buddha realm, while the second is experienced from the first stage of bodhisattva 菩萨 practice and above. (3) The transformation body, by which he can appear in any form. This body is manifested according to the arousal of the wisdom which brings the salvation of sentient beings to fulfillment.             From this, Buddha-body theory was expanded from three, to four, and even up to ten Buddha- bodies. Among these, the Maha^ya^na theory of the three bodies--the Dharma-body, the Reward-body, and the Response-body is most common. The Dharma body 法身 is considered to be the eternal indestructible true principle, the Buddha's original body. The Response body 应身 is considered to be the Buddha's manifest body, but in Maha^ya^na Buddhism is regarded as the personification body, which from true principle manifests according to the temperaments and abilities of sentient beings in order to save them.             The Reward body 报身 (baoshen) is manifest as a combination of the other two, and is therefore not simply eternal true principle, nor simply an impermanent personality. Rather, it is an ideal body possessed by those who have awakened to the true principle based on meritorious practice. It is the living form of the eternal principle, possessing individuality. This is a general explanation, and there have been a large number of interpretations of buddha-body theory offered in the history of Buddhism, among which there are significant differences.Threefold Body of a Buddha  三身（法身、报身、化身）  They are   1.Dharma body, i.e. Dharmakaya - its own essential nature, common to all Buddhas.  2.Retribution body, i.e. Sambhogakaya - a body of bliss, which he receives for his own use and enjoyment.  3.Response and transformation body, i.e. Nirmanatkaya - he can appear in any form whenever and wherever necessary for the sake of crossing over others."Three carts." A metaphor of the Lotus Sutra 法华经, from the story of the 'burning house,' which is as follows: Some chi^dren are playing in a house, unaware that it is on fire. Their father induces them to come out by telling them that there are three carts outside, a goat-drawn cart, a deer-drawn cart and an oxcart. When they come out, all there really is, is a great white oxcart. These three carts are metaphors for the /sra^vaka 声闻 vehicle, the pratyekabuddha 缘觉 vehicle, and the bodhisattva vehicle. This story is told in order to explain that although there are "lesser vehicle" and "greater vehicle" in Buddhist teachings, in the final analysis, they are all methods aimed at the same enlightenment. The 'burning house' represents the deluded world of human beings. The chi^dren are the practitioners of the three vehicles. The goat cart represents the /sra^vaka vehicle, the deer cart represents the pratyekabuddha vehicle, and the ox cart represents the bodhisattva vehicle. When the chi^dren have been induced to come out of the house, the large identical white ox carts are prepared outside the gate to give to each chi^d. These are metaphors for the great compassion of the Buddha as he discards his expedient means and returns the practitioners to the true single Buddha vehicle. Students of the Lotus Sutra in China were divided into two main groups: one that considered the expedient ox cart and the (fourth) great white ox cart to be the same (therefore positing three vehicles). These were mainly the Faxiang 法相 and Sanlun 三论 schools. The other group, the "four vehicle thinkers" (Hua-yen 华严, T'ien-t'ai) 天台 maintained that the expedient ox cart and the great white ox cart are different. That is, the three vehicle thinkers consider the bodhisattva vehicle and the Buddha vehicle to be the same, while the four vehicle thinkers considered them to be different.The three Ka^/syapa brothers: Uruvilva^-Ka^/syapa 优楼频螺迦叶, Nadi^-Ka^/syapa 那提迦叶 and Gaya^-Ka^/syapa 伽耶迦叶. Originally they had been priests of the fire-sacrifice, with over a thousand disciples. When they were converted by S/a^kyamuni, they brought their followers with them. They were later instrumental in the organization of the Buddhist sangha.(1) The three sagely paths (i.e., paths where practice is based on enlightenment) of the Yoga^ca^ra school: the Path of Seeing 见道; the Path of cultivation 修道 and the path of No More Learning 无学道. 〔瑜伽论T 1579.30.435b〕 (2) The three evil destinies; 【参照: 三恶道】 (3) Defilement, the delusion from which defilement is generated and the karma which is generated from defilement.

One of the earliest schools of Buddhism that developed in India during the century subsequent to the passing away of the Buddha. The name of the sect implies the meaning of "those supporting the teachings of the elders" which means that this was a school that had conservative tendencies--an attempt to conserve the original teachings of the Buddha. They are the longest surviving of the original twenty sects that comprised what is often referred to as Nika^ya Buddhism 部派佛教 as they continue to be active to the present in Southeast Asian countries such as Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Thailand and Cambodia. The Therava^da school is known for its early conflict with the more liberal Maha^sa^m!ghika 大众部 school, which had espoused a revisionist approach to the Buddhist doctrine. Later schools of Mahayana Buddhism sometimes categorized the Therava^da 上座部 and other Nika^ya schools as being lesser vehicle, or Hi^naya^na 小乘.(1) In the Bodhisattvabhu^mi-su^tra, the mental state of the formless meditation heaven 无色界天. 〔菩萨地持经 T 1581.30.898b29〕 (2) 【参照: 上心烦恼】 〔二障义 HPC 1.802a8〕【参照: 上心烦恼】 〔俱舍论、 T 1559.29.213b21〕Also written 上心惑.

Translated by Bodhiruci in 525. A short but influential tatha^gatagarbha text that discusses the relationship between sentient beings and the dharmaka^ya 法身 (or dharmadha^tu 法界) as being one of equivalence within the medium of the tatha^gatagarbha 如来藏. The sermon begins with a question by S/a^riputra 舍利弗 as to whether the total number of sentient beings who transmigrate through the three realms and six destinies ever increases or decreases. The Buddha responds by explaining how views of increase and decrease are equivalent to the mistaken extremes of eternalism and nihi^ism. He then goes into depth explaining the nature of the tatha^gatagarbha in relation to the dharma body and sentient beings. The full title of the text is 佛说不增不减经. T 668.16.466-468.Non-determined, indeterminate (aniyata). (1) One of the six groups of mental functions, so named because they arise irregularly, and do not have a predilection for good or evil. The Abhidharma school lists eight of these, called the 不定地法. Yoga^ca^ra lists four, called the 不定法.

(4) To be mentally unsettled, not correctly entered into meditative concentration. (5) The indeterminate class of sentient beings 不定众.In Abhidharma theory, the indeterminate mental functions, which do not have a determinable good or evil nature, and do not always act in concomitance with the mind in all of its states (aniyata^-bhu^mika). These include reflection 寻, investigation 伺, sleepiness 眠, repentance 恶作, covetousness 贪, antipathy 嗔, pride 慢, and doubt 疑. Equivalent to this category in Yoga^ca^ra are the four indeterminate mental functions 四不定.The 'undetermined elements' which do not necessary arise in all states of mind, and therefore have no predisposition toward good or evil. In the Abhidharma, there are eight mental functions in this category, more precisely termed as 不定地法. In the Yoga^ca^ra 瑜伽行派 doctrine there are four of these mental functions: remorse (zhuihui 追悔), drowsiness (shuimian 睡眠), investigation (寻), and analysis (伺). Also called the "four indeterminates" 四不定.(ahimsa^) 'non-injury.'

The permeation of the pure self-essence of the mind of true thusness by ignorance or wisdom which then appears in the manifest world.(aprama^da): 'no laxity,' 'vigilance.' One of the ten 'virtue producing mental function' dharmas listed in the Abhidharma-ko/sa-bha^sya 俱舍论; one of the 'good mental function' elements in the doctrine of the Yoga^ca^ra 瑜伽行派. The mental function of resisting evil existences and cultivating good ones.

One of the five buddhas 五佛 of the vajradha^tu, whose realm is the northern region.【参照: 不空成就佛】Amoghavajra (705-774). A prolific translator who became one of the most politically powerful Buddhist monks in Chinese history, acknowledged as one of the eight patriarchs of the doctrine 傅授八祖 in Shingon lineages. Born in Samarkand of a Indian father and Sogdian mother, he went to China at age 10 after his father's death. In 719, he was ordained into the sangha by Vajrabodhi 金刚智 and became his disciple. After all foreign monks were expelled from China in 741, he and some associates went on a pilgrimage to gather texts, visiting Sri Lanka, Southeast Asia and India. During this voyage, he apparently met Nagabodhi 龙智, master of Vajrabodhi, and studied the Tattvasam!graha 金刚顶经 system at length. He returned to China in 746 with some five hundred volumes. In 750, he left the court to join the military governorship of Geshu Han 哥舒翰, for whom he conducted large-scale tantric initations 灌顶 at field headquarters. In 754, he translated the first portion of the Tattvasam!graha (T 865), the central text of Buddhist esotericism, which became one of his most significant accomplishments. He regarded its teachings as the most effective method for attaining enlightenment yet devised, and incorporated its basic schema in a number of writings. Amoghavajra was captured in general An Lushan's 安禄山 rebellion but in 757 was freed by loyalist forces, whereupon he performed rites to purify the capital and consolidate the security of the Tang state. Two years later, he initiated the emperor Suzong 肃宗 as a cakravartin 转轮王. In 765, Amoghavajra used his new rendition of the 'Scripture of Humane Kings' 仁王经 (T 246) in an elaborate ritual to counter the advance of a 200,000-strong army of Tibetans and Uighurs which was poised to invade Zhangan 长安. Its leader, Pugu Huaien 仆固怀恩, dropped dead in camp and his forces dispersed. The opulent Jingao temple 金阁寺 on Mount Wutai was completed in 767, a pet project of Amoghavajra's, and one of his many efforts to promote the bodhisattva Man~ju/sri^ 文殊菩萨 as the protector of China. Amoghavajra continued to perform rites to avert disaster at the request of the emperor Taizong 太宗. On his death in 774, three days of morning were officially declared, and he posthumously received various exalted titles. The Chinese monks Huiguo 惠果 and Huilin 慧琳 were among his most prominent successors. Seventy-seven texts were translated by Amoghavajra according to his own account, though many more, including original compositions, are ascribed to him in the Chinese canons. The following documents relate to his life and work: (T 2120) contains records of his personal correspondence, (T 2156) records lineages, there is a biography in the Fu facang yinyuan fu 付法藏因缘傅 (T 2058), and an account of his travels is given in (T 2157).(1) Unenlightenment; non-enlightenment. (2) The fundamental delusion that stands in opposition to the originally enlightened nature which is responsible for the Ina-Zbility of sentient beings to discern the that the fundamental nature of the the mind is suchness.

According to various scriptures, there are various levels of practice which are designated as the 'level (stage) of non-backsliding.' For example, in many Maha^ya^na texts, the level designated as 'non-backsliding' is the seventh of the 'ten abodes. But the Yoga^ca^rabhu^mi-/sa^stra (Yuqie shidi lun 瑜伽师地论) says that the stage of non-backsliding is the first of the ten bhu^mis (the stage of joy), and again, the Buddha-nature Treatise (Foxing lun 佛性论) says it is the first of the 'ten dedications of merit.'The stage of non-backsliding, or non-retrogression (avinirvatani^ya, avivartika), attained by the bodhisattva, after which his practice can never retrogress. 【参照: 不退】above.'The abiding of no-backsliding.'

Also called zhongyin 中阴 and zhongyun 中蕴. 〔瑜伽论 T 1579.30.282a18〕Same as 中有 and 中阴.Ma^dhyamika, one of the major streams of Indian Maha^ya^na Buddhism which was to have a profound impact on all subsequent forms of Buddhism which arose in East Asia and Tibet. Based chiefly in the "middle way" 中论 philosophy of Na^ga^rjuna 龙树, the Ma^dhyamika thinkers sought to investigate a middle ground between the two extremes of existence 有 or non-existence 无 of things. Seen through the logic of dependent co-arising 缘起, all things were seen to be lacking of inherent nature 自性--to be empty 空. The most important successor to Na^ga^rjuna in the development of this school was a^ryadeva 圣提婆 (170-270, also commonly written 提婆) who helped to complete the framework of the Ma^dhyamika system in his Catuh-/sataka 四百论, etc. He was followed a few centuries later by such figures as Buddhapa^lita (佛护, c.470-540), Bha^vaviveka (清辩, c. 490-570) and Candraki^rti (月称, c. 650), who worked out, each in their own ways various types of proofs for the explanation of and apprehension of the nature of emptiness. Some of the most important basic antagonistic positions within the broad Ma^dhyamika tradition can be seen in the disagreement between Bha^vaviveka and Candraki^rti: while Bha^vaviveka used one form of logical argumentation to establish the truth of emptiness in a positive manner, Candraki^rti denied the validity of the use of logical propositions which ended up affirming any sort of positive position. This basic disagreement would become embedded within the Ma^dhyamika school to the extent that two distinct philosophical factions developed: the Sva^trantika (Dulilunzhengpai 独立论证派), which basically followed the position of Bha^vaviveka and the Pra^san!gika (Guimiulunzhengpai 归谬论证派), which supported the opinion of Buddhapa^lita and Candraki^rti. Some later (eighth century) Ma^dhyamika thinkers such as S/a^ntaraks!ita 寂护 and Kamala/si^la 莲华戒 blended the Ma^dhyamika theories together with that of the Yoga^ca^ra movement, which had risen in popularity during the fifth century. The Three-treatise school 三论宗 which arose in East Asia was based primarily in the basic positions of the school's earliest thinkers, Na^ga^rjuna and a^ryadeva.The Zhongguan lun shou; T 1824.42.1a-169b.The Madhyamaka-/sa^stra; 4 fasc., attributed to Na^ga^rjuna; 龙树T 1564.30.1a-39c.

A seminal Yoga^ca^ra text that is traditionally said to be a writing of Maitreya 弥勒 with Vasubandhu's commentary, but is considered by scholars to more likely be the joint effort of Asan%ga 无著 and Vasubandhu 世亲. The special focus of this text is on the Yoga^ca^ra articulation of the meaning of mistaken discrimination 虚妄分别 vs. the meaning of emptiness of inherent nature 空性, with the aim of breaking attachment to extreme notions of emptiness 有 and existence 无.

One Chinese translation of the Sanskrit pa^ramita^ (波罗密). 〔正法华经 263.9.88a29〕The "phenomenal hindrances," which, according to the Sutra of Perfect Enlightenment, along with the "noumenal hindrances" (lizhang 理障) impede the attainment of enlightenment. The phenomenal hindrances are those of the human passions of like and dislike, and all other related addictive or painful emotions which keep sentient beings bound in the cycle of life and death. Therefore, these hindrances are analogous to the "hindrances of affliction" (fannaozhang 烦恼障) of the school of Consciousness-only. Compared to the hindrances of principle, they are relatively superficial, and thus may be overcome by the practices of the two vehicles 二乘. (圆觉经, T 842.17.916b20 ff.)(1) Two, second. (2) Duality; "two-ness", "self and other."(1) Two kinds of karmic reward: specific 满业 and general 引业. (2) Good action 善业 and evil action 恶业.The "two vehicles" of /sra^vaka 声闻 and pratyekabuddha 辟支佛. These two practitioners are regularly introduce in Maha^ya^na literature where they are cast in a negative light as representatives of the so-called "hi^naya^na" 小乘 tradition, where they are set up in contradistinction to the bodhisattva 菩萨. They are understood as practitioners who are engaged in a view toward practice and enlightenment which will permit them to reach the level of arhatship 阿罗汉 and not Buddhahood. This means that they are able to permanently sever the multitude of afflictions engendered by the three poisons 三毒. But they are unable to progress further along the path in the manner of the bodhisattva due to a lack in the development of their compassion 慈悲 for other beings as well as a limitation in their understanding of the emptiness 空 of all phenomena 法. One of the first Maha^ya^na scriptures to make detailed distinctions between the practitioners of the two vehicles and the bodhisattvas was the S/ri^ma^la^-su^tra 胜□经.Two kinds of defilement: the dirty aspects that exist with the body such as blood, puss, phlegm, etc. and the dirty aspects that appear on the outside of the body, such as inflammation, swelling, rotten skin, etc. 〔瑜伽论、 T 1579.30.428c〕Two loci of reliance in the Yogacarabhumi-/sa^stra: (1) the proper discernment of the true principle that pervades all phenomena and (2) faith and understanding in the spiritual power of individual existence (pudgala). 〔瑜伽论T 1579.30.〕The two entrances to enlightenment as found in the teachings of Bodhidharma and in the Vajrasama^dhi-sutra 金刚三昧经.

An in-depth treatise concerning the various theories developed on the doctrine of the two hindrances 二障 of the Yoga^ca^ra school 瑜伽行派, by Wonhyo 元晓. HPC 1.789-814. This treatise examines and compares the various explications regarding the two hindrances as found in the major Yoga^ca^ra texts, most prominent of which are the Yoga^ca^rabhu^mi-/sa^stra 瑜伽论, Sam!dhinirmocana-su^tra 解深密经, Maha^ya^na^bhidharma-samuccaya-vya^khya^ 对法论, S/ri^ma^la^devi^-simhana^da-su^tra 胜□经 and Prakarana^ryava^ca-/sa^stra 显扬论. Wonhyo first defines characteristics the hindrances in great depth, in terms of both esoteric an exoteric interpretations. He then explains how they are to be removed in terms of the various Yoga^ca^ra path scenarios, how their removal is handled by different classes of practitioners, and so forth. It is one of the most instructive works available for understanding the Buddhist notions of defilment/affliction and the obstructions to enlightenment created by the discriminating human mind.Two Obstacles  二障（烦恼障、所知障）  Two Obstacles refer to   1.the obstacle of afflictions   2.the obstacle of what is known(1) And so forth...

They are primarily explained in the Abhidharmako/sa-bha^sya 俱舍论, and the Thirty Verses on Consciousness-only, both written by Vasubandhu 世亲. In Consciousness-only, these five are: the stage of accumulation (资粮位), the stage of preparation (加行位), the stage of proficiency (通达位), the stage of practice (修习位) and the stage of completion (究竟位). In the Abhidharmako/sa-bha^sya, they are the stage of accumulation (资粮位), the stage of preparation (加行位), the stage of seeing the Way (见道位), the stage of cultivating the way (修道位), and the stage of no more learning (无学位).

The five classifications of Huayan 华严 and Tiantai 天台 are the most common, but during the early period of classification (the period of division of China into northern and southern dynasties) there were a number of classifications done. A few of these are as follows:  (A) That propounded by Zigui 自轨 consists of these five: (1) the teaching of causal arising (Sarva^stiva^din, etc.); (2) the teaching of provisional names (Chengshi lun, etc.); (3) the teaching of the negation of reality (Prajn~a^pa^ramita^ sutras); (4) the teaching of reality (Nirva^na Sutra); (5) the teaching of the Reality-realm (Avatam!saka Su^tra).  (B) The classification done by Huikuan 慧观 and Fayan 法云 of (1) the teaching of the existence of form (a^gama s); (2) the teaching of the non-existence of form (Prajn~a^pa^ramita^ sutras); (3) Restraining and praising teaching (Vimalaki^rti Sutra etc.) 维摩经; (4) the Teaching of Same Meaning (Lotus Sutra) 法华经 and (5) the Eternal Teaching (Nirva^na Sutra) 涅盘经.  (C) The Huayan scheme, as taught by Fazang 法藏, consists of the following five: (1) xiaoshengjiao 小乘教 Hi^naya^na teaching; (2) dashengshijiao 大乘始教 Elementary doctrine of Maha^ya^na, which refers to Faxiang and Sanlun 三论 teachings; (3) dashengzhongjiao 大乘终教 the Final Doctrine of Maha^ya^na, which asserts the existence of Buddha-nature in all beings; (4) dashengdunjiao 大乘顿教 the Sudden Enlightenment doctrine of Maha^ya^na and (5) dashengyuanjiao 大乘圆教 the perfect doctrine of Maha^ya^na, namely Huayan teaching."five doctrinal schools and two (meditational) schools." Referring to the situation of the official classification of Buddhist sects in Korea during the Koryo, subsequent to the 五教九山 classification. The two meditational schools at this point were Ch'ont'ae 天台 and Son 禅.The five doctrinal schools and "nine mountain" schools. A description of the official situation of the Buddhist sangha from the end of the Silla through most of the Koryo period. These would both be consolidated in the Choson into the "two sects" of Kyo 教 and Son 禅.【参照: 华严五教章】'five teaching periods.' A division of the periods of the varying methods used by S/a^kyamuni to explain the dharma from the time he attained enlightenment until the time he entered nirvana. Though there are various theories regarding these five, all are generally derived from the original explanation propounded by Huikuan 慧观 in the fifth century. (A) Huikuan's explanation divides the teaching into gradual 渐 and sudden 顿, further dividing sudden into the following five: (1) the Distinct Teaching of the Three Vehicles (a^gama Sutras, etc.); (2) the Three Vehicle Shared Teaching (Prajn~a^pa^ramita^ Su^tra s, etc.); (3) the Restraining and Praising Teaching (Vimalaki^rti Sutra 维摩经, etc.); (4) the Teaching of the Shared Intent (Avatam!saka-su^tra 华严经, etc.) and (5) the Eternal Teaching (Nirva^na-su^tra 涅盘经, etc.). This is the classification of the "Nirva^na school." (B) In the Huayan teaching of Liuqiu 刘 the Avatam!saka-su^tra is called the "Sudden teaching" and the "gradual teaching" is divided into the following five: (1) The Teaching of Men and Gods; (2) The Teaching of the Existence of Form (the a^gamas and so forth, that accept the existence of discriminated forms); (3) The Formless Teaching (prajn~a^pa^ramita^ teaching, etc., that denies the real existence of form); (4) The Teaching of Shared Intent (Lotus Sutra, etc.) and (5) The Eternal Teaching (Nirva^na Sutra etc.) (C) Zhiyi altered the above (B) somewhat. According to Tiantai 天台 teaching, the five periods are: (1) The Huayan period. After the Buddha's enlightenment, he expounded the Avatam!saka-su^tra for 21 days for bodhisattvas. This was a teaching for those of very sharp faculties, and according to this teaching such bodhisattvas may directly awaken to the reality-principle. (2) The Deer Park period. After delivering the Avatam!saka-su^tra, ordinary people of undeveloped faculties are not able to understand, so he discards this teaching in favor of guiding people through expedient teachings. Thus he delivered the lesser vehicle teachings at Deer Park near Benares. This period was twelve years, and the scriptures that developed from this are the a^gamas, so it is also called the "a^gama period." (3) The Vaipulya period (Elementary Maha^ya^na). For the people that had grasped the Hi^naya^na teachings, the Buddha now teaches Maha^ya^na Sutras such as the Vimalaki^rti Sutra, the Su^tra of the Golden Light and the Srimala Su^tra 胜□经, broadly explaining the Tripitaka, Shared, Distinct and Perfect Teachings. This is intended to convert people from Hi^naya^na to Maha^ya^na. This period lasts for eight years. (4) Perfection of Wisdom. For 22 years the Buddha teaches the Prajn~a^pa^ramita^ sutras in order to awaken people to the principle of emptiness. (5) The Lotus and Nirva^na period. The Buddha makes clear that the final goal of Hi^naya^na and Maha^ya^na is to same. Thus it is also called the Teaching of the Single Vehicle, wherein the presence of Buddha-nature in each person is affirmed.A doctrinal classification system as explained by Zhiyi. The order in which S/a^kyamuni taught the dharma is broken down into five periods (see wu-chiao 五教). The methods which he used are also broken down into four types, and the contents of the teaching into four categories. (A) The four methods of teaching are: (1) the Sudden Teaching 顿教, which is the teaching of the direct awakening to the Buddha-nature; (2) the Gradual Teaching 渐教, where one is lead from shallow understanding to deep understanding; (3) the Secret Indeterminate Teaching, where the aspirants secretly receive teaching appropriate to their own abilities without being aware of the presence of others and (4) the Express Indeterminate Teaching, where the listeners, though aware of each other, still receive teaching according to their individual capacities. There is, in addition to this, the method of "neither sudden nor gradual, neither secret nor variable", also known as the "method of the Lotus and Nirva^na Sutras. (B) The four types of content are (1) Hi^naya^na or "Tripitaka" teachings; (2) "Pervasive" or "Shared" 通 teachings. This is Maha^ya^na teaching that includes the teaching of Vaipulya, Prajn~a^pa^ramita^, Lotus and Nirva^na, and is for /sra^vakas, pratyekabuddhas and bodhisattvas; (3) the Distinct Teaching. This is teaching for bodhisattvas only. The practitioners understanding has its emphasis on the middle truth of understanding emptiness and existence. Huayan teaching is typical of this type. (4) The Perfect Teaching. Enlightenment and delusion do not differ in essence. The teaching of the perfect mutual penetration and containment of all things, the explanation of the Buddha's enlightenment exactly as it is. The perfect teaching is actually contained in all the other teachings, but is most excellently put forth in the Lotus Sutra 法华经.【参照: 五时八教】above.Five Wisdoms  五智  1.Wisdom of the Embodied Nature of Dharma Realm法界体性智   - derived from amala-vijanana, i.e. pure consciousness (or mind).   2.Wisdom of the Great Round Mirror大圆镜智  - derived from alaya-vijanana, (8th consciousness) reflecting all things.   3.Wisdom in regard to all things equally and universally平等性智  - derived from manovijanana (7th consciousness).   4.Wisdom of profound insight, or discrimination, for exposition and doubt - destruction妙观察智  - derived from the mind consciousness (6th consciousness).   5.Wisdom of perfecting the double work of self welfare and the welfare of others成所作智  - derived from the five senses (1st to 5th consciousness).【参照: 五佛】The five buddhas as incarnations of distinct types of wisdom: (1) Maha^vairocana, who embodies the complete wisdom of the essential nature of the dharmadha^tu 法界体性智; (2) Aks!obhya, who embodies the great perfect mirror wisdom 大圆镜智; (3) Ratnasam!bha^va, who embodies the wisdom of equality in nature; (4) Amita^bha, who embodies the wisdom of subtle observing wisdom 妙观察智, and (5) Either Amoghasiddhi or S/a^kyamuni, who embody the wisdom that is developed through practice. 成所作智. 【参照: 五佛】(1) The clarification into five categories of all cause and effect relationships.

(pan~ca-skandha). 'five skandhas', 'five aggregates', 'five clusters.' Also translated into Chinese as 五阴 and 五众. 'Skandha' 蕴 means 'accumulation' or 'gathering.' The collection of the five compositional elements of our existence. The viewpoint that all existence, including our own, lies in the relationship of five clusters. The assembly of mind and matter, or spirit and matter. The five skandhas are the division of matter and mind into five categories, which are form, feeling, perception, impulse and consciousness. 'Form' 色 (ru^pa) is matter in general, the body or materiality. 'Feeling' 受 (vedana^) is receptive or sensory function. 'Perception' 想 (samjn~a^) refers to images that surface in the mind. Symbolic function. 'Impulse' 行 (samska^ra) is will, intention, or the mental function that accounts for craving. The power of formation potential. It is also understood as all of the general mental functions not included in the skandhas of feeling or perception. 'Consciousness' 识 (vijn~a^na) is the cognitive, or discriminating function. Knowing through discrimination.(1) Five practices in Maha^ya^na Buddhism as taught in the Awakening of Faith 起信论--the first five of the six perfections: giving 布施, morality 持戒, patience 忍辱, effort 精进, and meditation 止观. (2) The five practices of the bodhisattvas taught in the Maha^parinirva^n!a-su^tra 涅盘经: the three disciplines 圣行; compassionate deeds on behalf of sentient beings 梵行; spontaneous acts on behalf of others 天行; manifest good suitable for secular people and lesser vehicle practitioners 婴儿行; and appearing in a suitable manifestation for those in need of help 病行. (3) The five phases of early Chinese cosmology: wood 木, fire 火, earth 土, metal 金, and water 水. First seen in the "Great Plan" 洪范 chapter of the Book of History 书经.

Being unhappy in seatFive kinds of mistaken perception, the "five views" (pan~ca-dr!s!t!i), also written as 五恶见 and 恶见. These are: (1) "Self view"--the attached view of the reality of the inherent existence of one's own self, coupled with the belief in the real selfhood of the objects in one's surrounding world (satka^ya-dr!s!t!i). Expressed as 我见, 身见 and 有身见. (2) Extreme view 边见, which is attachment to the positions of either eternalism or nihi^ism (antaparigraha-dr!s!t!i). (3) Evil view 邪见 (mithya^-dr!s!t!i), wherein one does not properly acknowledge the relationship of cause and effect). (4) The view of attachment to views 见取见, i.e., holding rigidly to one opinion over all others. (dr!s!t!i-para^mar/sa-dr!s!t!i). (5) The view of rigid attachment to the precepts 戒禁取见. The view that the austerities, moral practices and vows of non-Buddhist sects can lead one to the truth (/si^la-vrata-para^mar/sa-dr!s!t!i). This set of views without the last, are called the four views 四见.The five consciousnesses produced in connection with the five sense organs of eyes, ears, nose, tongue and skin, which take as their objects the five physical categories of form, sound, smell, taste and tactile objects: therefore, the visual consciousness 眼识, auditory consciousness 耳识, olfactory consciousness 鼻识, gustatory consciousness 舌识 and tactile consciousness 身识. Since these are considered to be the first five among the six consciousnesses 六识, they are commonly referred to as the "prior five consciousnesses" in Chinese, 前五识. In the doctrine of the Yoga^ca^ra school, these are the first five among the eight consciousnesses 八识. In terms of the three realms , those in the desire realm are said to have six consciousnesses; those in the first meditation heaven of the form realm lack the olfactory and gustatory consciousnesses, while those in the second meditation heaven and above maintain only the sixth (discriminating) consciousness. (panca-vijn~a^na)〔俱舍论〕 {II} The five consciousnesses taught in the Awakening of Faith: (1) The activity (karmic) consciousness 业识, which arises with the unenlightened mind due to original ignorance. (2) The changing (transforming) consciousness 转识, wherein the activity consciousness undergoes a single transformation producing the subjective view. (3) The manifesting consciousness 现识, in which based on transformation of the activity consciousness the objective world is manifested. (4) The knowing consciousness 智识, in which the mind creates mistaken discrimination based on its perception of the objects in the external world. (5) The continuing consciousness 相续识, wherein, based on mistaken discrimination, the thoughts of pain and pleasure continue without abatement, thus enabling the continuity of sam!sa^ra. 〔起信论、 T 1666.32.577b〕Also written 五道  The Gorin kuji myo^ himitsu shaku (Commentary on the Secrets of the Five Cakras and Nine Syllables). 1 fasc.

The five levels of the apprehension of the principle of consciousness-only 唯识. These are five kinds of distinctions made in level of realization, from shallow to deep. They are: (1) The consciousness of expelling the false and abiding in the real; (2) The consciousness of the expulsion of confusion and holding to true awareness; (3) Holding to the function and returning to the essence; (4) Concealing the mean and manifesting the superior; (5) dispelling manifestations and apprehending the true nature. This theory of five layers appears in Kuiji's Dasheng fayuanyi linzhang 大乘法圆义林章.

Transcend.Hyujong (1520-1604); a Choson dynasty Son monk who can be counted among the five most important figures in Korean Buddhist history; commonly known in Korea by the respectful title Sosan Taesa 西山大师. He was an influential teacher and writer, who is said to have guided hundreds of students, a number of whom turned into Son masters in their own right. He played a major role in consolidating the forms of study and practice of Korean Son which would, by and large, remain in place down to modern times. What has made Hyujong most respected in the broad view of Korean history was his role in the creation and guidance of an army of monks, which played a decisive role in the eventual repulsion of the Japanese invasion by the armies of Hideyoshi Toyotomi 秀吉礼臣.  In addition to serving in this unusual capacity of military leader, Sosan was a first-rate Son master and the author of a number of important religious texts, the most important of which is his Songa kwigam 禅家龟鉴, a guide to Son practice which is studied by Korean monks down to the present. Like most monks of the Choson period, he had been initially educated in Neo-Confucian philosophy. Dissatisfied, he wandered through the mountain monasteries, eventually joining the sangha. Later, after making a name for himself as a teacher, he was made arbiter of the Son school by queen Munjong. He soon resigned from this responsibility, returning to the itinerant life, advancing his Son studies and teaching at monasteries all around Korea. He died at 85, leaving behind some 1000 disciples, 70 of whom were monks and nuns, and many of whom held a prominent role in the later transmission of Choson Buddhism.  Hyujong is also known for his efforts in the continuation of the project of the unification of Buddhist doctrinal study and practice. He is considered the central figure in the revival of Choson Buddhism, and most major streams of modern Korean Son trace their lineages back to him through one of his four main disciples: Yujong 惟政; Ongi 彦机, T'aenung 太能 and Ilson 一禅, all four of whom were assistants to Sosan during the war with Japan.(1) To surpass, excel, be superior.

He was known for the the development of a negative dialectic in the proof of the concept of emptiness, which put his way of thinking at odds with such Ma^dhyamika masters as Bha^vaviveka (清辩, c. 490-570), but in agreement with later figures such as Candraki^rti (月称, c. 650). Some of the most important basic antagonistic positions within the broad Ma^dhyamika tradition can be seen in the disagreement between Bha^vaviveka and Buddhapa^lita: while Bha^vaviveka used one form of logical argumentation to establish the truth of emptiness in a positive manner, Buddhapa^lita denied the validity of the use of logical propositions which ended up affirming any sort of positive position. The position taken by Buddhapa^lita and Candraki^rti would later end up in the creation of a distinct branch of Ma^dhyamika called Pra^san!gika (guimiulunzhengpai 归谬论证派).The Buddha's wisdom (buddha-jn~a^na). 〔法华经, T 262.9.6a15〕Same as omniscience 一切智.The buddha's wisdom (buddha-jn~a^na); one who has the wisdom of the buddha.

A discussion of the Buddhist teachings between the Buddha and a^nanda.(buddha-ru^pa; buddha-ka^ya). The Buddha's (physical) body. As a result of the questions of Buddhist followers, inquiries were made resulting in "buddha-body theory." S/a^kyamuni himself established the position of believing in the true principle (dharma): that he himself would die but the dharma was indestructible and therefore said that after his death the dharma was to be depended upon. However, many disciples held to their concept of the Buddha's person and believed in it as the Buddha-dharma, and therefore, even while S/a^kyamuni was still in the world his body had come to be seen as transcendent. Because of this, after he died, the dharma that he had explained was regarded as indestructible, and was set up in contrast with his natural body, bringing about a 'two body' theory.Literally, the "buddha-way," which means the path to the buddhahood, but also often refers the Buddha's enlightenment in itself; buddhahood. The terms seems to have developed in East Asia without a Sanskrit equivalent (although it can be equated with the Indian concept of bodhi), often used to indicate the enlightenment which is the original endowment of all sentient beings. See, for example T 842.17.913c (圆觉经).(1) Chinese transcription of the Sanskrit buddha, meaning "awakened," or the "awakened one." Most East Asian writers and translators shortened this to the first character 佛. (2) These two characters also form the first part of the names of many monks from India and Central Asia.Buddhagaya^, the name of the place where S/a^kyamuni is recorded as having attained his enlightenment. Pronounced in modern Hindi as Bodhgaya^. Located about 10 km. south of the modern day city of Gaya in Biharu.Buddhatra^ta, the name given in the colophon of the Sutra of Perfect Enlightenment 圆觉经 as its "translator." The facticity of this is questionable, since it seems fairly certain that the sutra was composed in China. Buddhatra^ta's name also does not seem to be found in connection with any other texts.Buddha/sa^nta, whose name is translated into Chinese according to its meaning as Jueding 觉定. Originally from northern India, he came in 511 to the Northern Wei, where he cooperated with Bodhiruci 菩提流支 and Ratnamati 勒那摩提 in the translation of the Da/sabhu^mika-/sa^stra 十地经论. He later resided at White Horse Temple, where he translated the Maha^ya^na-sam!graha 摄大乘论 and other texts. His dates of birth and death are unclear.Buddhasena; 【参照: 佛大先】Buddhabhadra: (1) Of Kapilavastu, who came to China in 408.

After the experience of the path of seeing 见道, the practitioner renews his efforts based on this new insight, seeking further accordance with reality. The afflictions that are eliminated in this path are those that are more deeply embedded, such as the innately arisen afflictions (俱生、思惑), whereas the prior path of seeing is able to eliminate the less deeply embedded afflictions (分别起、见惑). In the Abhidharmako/sa, the entry into this stage is equivalent to that of stream winner 预流. 〔瑜伽论 T 1579.30.313b2〕【参照: 修道】(1) Together with... (sardham, sahita).

Afflictions, karma, etc., that have been carried over from previous lifetimes, which are therefore more deeply embedded. These are usually considered to be removable during the Path of Cultivation 修道. These are contrasted to the afflictions produced by discrimination in the present lifetime 分别烦恼, which can be removed earlier, in the Path of Seeing 见道.(1) Inherently arisen; inborn, innate. (2) Especially refers to innate afflictions 俱生烦恼 that are present in one's mind due to the karma of prior existences. Synonymous with 任运起. (3) The innate afflictions are said to be eradicated in the course of the Path of Cultivation 修道.'Simultaneously produced hindrances,' or 'innate hindrances.' A term used by the Yoga^ca^ra school 瑜伽行派. Hindrances that arise simultaneously with the mind. In the attachment to self, there is attachment due to discriminating a self through thought. Yet even when purposely suppressing this kind of thought, there is a spontaneously arisen attachment to self. Even though one is trying not to give rise to such thought and trying to suppress the self-view, still an attachment to self arises. This is what is called "arising together with the mind." This arising occurs in the seventh consciousness as well as the sixth consciousness. The seeds produced by this hindrance are different from those produced by the 'discriminated arising' 分别障 hindrance. Since the discriminated arising hindrance is cut off when one awakens to the principle of dependent origination, they are cut off at one time during the Path of Seeing (jiandao 见道). However, the hindrance of simultaneous arising is habituated, so even if one understands the principle of the Way, the hindrance will still arise. Since the habituated nature has developed, one must repeatedly practice the contemplation of dependent origination in order to cut off this hindrance. 【参照: 俱生起】 Also written 俱生烦恼.(1) To include, keep, store, maintain (). Translated into Chinese as 藏. (2) A reference to the Abhidharmako/sa-bha^sya 俱舍论 or the Abhidharma school 俱舍宗 of Buddhism.Jushe lun; shortened popular title of the 阿毗达磨俱舍论。

As distinguished from wisdom liberation 慧解脱, where one uses wisdom alone to accomplish freedom from the hindrances of affliction 烦恼障, one instead uses both wisdom and concentration to liberate oneself both from the hindrances of affliction, and the hindrances of liberation 解脱障. Due to this liberation, one attains the sama^dhi of total annihi^ation 灭尽定. One of the 二十七坚圣 and one of the nine no-more-learnings 九无学. 〔瑜伽论 T 1579.30.832b18〕(1) Upside down, perverted, inverted, contrary, mistaken. Same as 颠倒. (viparya^sa, viparyaya, paryasta, viparita).

Signified in Confucianism with the character 权. In the doctrine of the Tiantai 天台 sect, according to the true teaching, the real characteristic of human existence is provisionality. (5) The term 假 is usually used in contrast to terms like truth 真, or reality 实, referring to something that is empty, or unsubstantial, lacking inherent existence; something that exists only in reference to the name assigned to it. This is called jiamingyou 假名有. This sort of existence is not different from emptiness. The term 假 is also used to refer to 'expedient means' (fangbian 方便), or methods of practice and teaching that have no real nature, but are used provisionally.A provisional combination--the way Buddhists see the human being as composed of four elements and five skandhas (Tib. skabs las byung ba). 〔佛氏杂辨、佛氏真假之辨〕Schools that hold to the doctrine that all naming is provisional, such as the Sautra^ntika 经量部 and the Cheng-shi 成实宗schools.A provisional, temporary existence or thing.

(3) Brave, martial.(ga^tha^) (1) A verse praising the merit of the Buddha. The poetry of the sutras, as contrasted to narrative: 长行). (2) In his commentary to the Sutra of Perfect Enlightenment (圆觉经), Zongmi describes four types of ga^tha^: (a) 阿耨 都婆颂 which does not ask questions about the prior prose and which is composed of verses of 32 ideographs; (b) qietuosong 伽陀颂 which is also called fengsong 讽颂 and zhisong 直颂 and which explains the dharma in verse without necessarily explaining the prior prose text; (c) qiyesong 只夜颂which is also called yingsong 应颂 and (d) jishisong 集施颂 which indicates that much meaning is contained in few words (Z vol. 9, 351c). One of the twelve traditional genre divisions of the Buddhist canon 十二部经.(1) Inclined to one side. Leaning, partial, prejudiced. Determined, in a bad sense. (2) Sometimes, due to graphical similarities, this word is also used for its exact opposite 遍 and 遍, meaning whole, perfect, universal. (3) To transform, overturn, change.Bias.

HPC 7.252b-278c.Steadfast, determined, unmoving. One-pointed effort.Wonhyo (617-686). One of the leading thinkers, writers and commentators of the Korean Buddhist tradition. With his life spanning the end of the Three Kingdoms period and the beginning of the Unified Silla, Wonhyo played a vital role in the reception and assimilation of the broad range of doctrinal Buddhist streams that flowed into the Korean peninsula at the time. Wonhyo was most interested in, and affected by Tatha^gatagarbha 如来藏, Consciousness-only 唯识 and Hwaom 华严 thought. However, in his extensive scholarly works, addressed in commentaries and essays, he embraced the whole spectrum of the Buddhist teachings which were received in Korea, including such schools as Pure Land 净土宗, Nirvana 涅盘宗, Sanlun 三论宗 and Tiantai 天台宗 (Lotus Sutra school). He wrote commentaries on virtually all of the most influential Maha^ya^na scriptures, altogether including over eighty works in over two hundred fascicles. Among his most influential works were the commentaries he wrote on the Awakening of Faith 大乘起信论, Nirvana Sutra 涅盘经 and Vajrasama^dhi Sutra 金刚三昧经. These were treated with utmost respect by leading Buddhist scholars in China and Japan, and served to help in placing the Awakening of Faith as the most influential text in the Korean tradition.  Wonhyo spent the earlier part of his career as a monk, but after a "consciousness-only" enlightenment experience, he left the priesthood and turned to the spreading of the buddhadharma as a layman. Because of this aspect of his character, Wonhyo ended up becoming a popular folk hero in Korea. He was a colleague and friend of the influential Silla Hwaom monk Uisang 义湘, and an important result of their combined works was the establishment of Hwaom as the dominant stream of doctrinal thought on the Korean peninsula. Wonhyo's 23 extant works are currently in the process of being translated into English as a joint project between Dongguk University and SUNY at Stony Brook.The head, leader, chief, ruler, sovereign, best, first, beginning.To be filled with, to be pregnant with, teem with (pu^rna).To be full, be whole, be complete.(kirana).

A text that is supposed to be an introduction to the Abhidharmako/sa-bha^sya 俱舍论, focusing especially on the framework of the 75 elemental constructs 七十五法. According to Nakamura, Tocharian fragments and the Tibetan version of this text suggest that Xuanzang translated it arbitrarily. There is a French translation, using the Tibetan and Chinese versions, by Van Velthem.Eight Negations  八不  The eight negations of Nagarjuna, founder of Madhyamika, are actually four pairs of neither birth nor death, neither end nor permanence, neither identity nor difference, neither coming nor going.

According to this doctrine, sentient beings possess eight distinct layers of consciousness, the first five 五识 corresponding the sense perceptions, the sixth 意识 to the thinking mind, the seventh 末那识 to the notion of ego, and the eighth 阿赖耶识 as repository of all the impressions from one's experiences. As the first seven of these arise based on the eighth, they are called the transformed consciousnesses 转识. In contrast, the eighth is known as the base consciousness 本识, store consciousness 藏识, or seed consciousness 种子识. 〔成唯识论 T 1585.31.〕(Verses on the Structure of the Eight Consciousnesses).

(2) the truth of suffering by destruction 坏苦谛，wherein one suffers by the disappearance of desirable objects. (3) the truth of everyday suffering 苦苦谛，wherein one meets disagreeable objects. (4) the truth of transmigration 流转谛，or fragmentary sam!sa^ra 分段生死. (5) the truth of the cessation of transmigration 流息谛，or nirvana 涅盘. (6) the truth of defilement 杂染谛，or affliction 烦恼. (7) the truth of purity 清净谛，where one eliminates afflictions upon ascertaining their unconditioned nature. (8) the truth of correct expedient means 正方便谛. 〔瑜伽师地论卷四十六、大乘法苑义林章卷二末〕Eight kinds of evil (errors).

In order for the dha^ran!i^ to be effective, the practitioner should renounce the world, live a virtuous life and understand the significance of the eight seed syllables (aks!arabi^ja 种字: pa, la, ba, ja, ka, dha, /sa, ks!a). The presence of such practices in this relatively early text indicates its strong influence on the development of Buddhist esotericism. Of the eight Chinese translations, Amoghavajra's 不空 version is authoritative for the Shingon school 真言宗. They are, in historical order:  (1) 1 fasc. (T 1011.19.680-682) Sublime Sustainer Sutra of the Immeasurable Portal 无量门微密持经, tr. Zhiqian 支谦.

T 2025.48.1109c-1160b.Ratnamati, whose name is translated into Chinese according to its meaning as Baoyi 宝意. A scholar-monk who came from central India to China to do significant translation work. He came to Loyang in the Northern Wei in 508, where he worked together with Bodhiruci 菩提流支 in the translation of the Da/sabhu^mika-/sa^stra 十地经论. Apparently he had significant disagreements with Bodhiruci in the process of the translation work, and left to work on other projects,1 being listed as a collaborator in the translation of a dozen or so other works. His chief disciple was Huiguang 慧光, who founded the southern branch of the Dilun school 地论宗.  (1) Lusthaus comments: "The tradition has not been as clear as we'd like about what exactly the difference was that sparked the disagreement between Bodhiruci (himself a good Yogacarin) and Ratnamati, and the so-called Dilun controversies of the 6th century obscure rather than illuminate them. The issue may have been -- already then -- Ratnamati's tendency to read in tatha^gatagarbha ideas. Not that Bodhiruci would have been averse to tatha^gatagarbha per se, but he wanted to render the texts in a manner true to the meaning as he understood it, in an orthodox Yogacarin sense (though the Dilun is not exactly a blatantly Yogacara text), and resented Ratnamati's intrusions."

Consists primarily of an explanation of the bodhisattva stages contained in the Huayan jing.'Ten buddhas.' In the Huayan kongmu zhang 华严孔目章, there are two kinds of ten Buddhas. The first ten are the ten buddhas of the realm of understanding. The bodhisattva, relying on the true wisdom of awakening, perceives that the dharma realm is all Buddha in ten aspects (bodies). These are the body of sentient beings, the body of lands, the karma reward body, the body of Buddhist disciples (arhats), the pratyekabuddha body, the bodhisattva body, the body of completely enlightened ones (tatha^gatas), the body of knowledge, the reality-body, and the body of space. The second group of ten are the buddhas of the realm of practice. These are the correct enlightenment Buddha, the desire-to-save-sentient- beings Buddha, the karma-reward Buddha, the holding-fast Buddha, the transformation Buddha, the dharma-realm Buddha, the mind Buddha, the sama^dhi Buddha, the original nature Buddha, and the Buddha who becomes what he wishes.Ten Titles of Buddha  十佛名号  represent the characteristics of Buddha   1.Tathagata - the Thus Come Ones   2.Arhat - worthy of offerings   3.Samyak-sambuddha - of proper and universal knowledge   4.Vidyacarna-sampauna - perfect in understanding and conduct   5.Sugata - skilful in leaving the world through liberation   6.Lokavid - perfect and complete understanding of all worldly Dharma   7.Anuttara - unsurpassed knights   8.Purusa-damya-sarathi - taming heroes   9.Sasta deramanusyanam - teachers of gods and people   10.Buddha-lokanatha or Bhagaran - Buddha, the World Honored OnesThe ten fetters (delusions, afflictions): desire 欲, hatred 嗔, ignorance 痴, pride 慢, doubt 疑, view of self 身见, extreme view 边见, evil view 邪见, view of attachment to views 见取见, view of morality 戒禁取见.

Mu^dras became especially relevant in Maha^ya^na esoteric schools 密教, where they were used to accompany the performance of liturgies and the recitation of mantras 咒.

"Consciousness-only (vijn~apti-ma^trata^)." The theory that all existence is nothing but consciousness, and therefore there is nothing that lies outside of the mind. Consciousness-only was a major component of the thought of the school of Yoga^ca^ra 瑜伽行派. The Vijn~a^nava^dins explained the regularity and coherence of sense impressions as due to an underlying store of perceptions (a^laya-vijn~a^na) 阿赖耶识 evolving from the accumulation of traces of earlier sense perceptions. These are active, and produce impressions 种子 similar to themselves, according to a regular pattern, as seeds produce plants. Each being possesses a store of perceptions and beings which are generically alike will produce similar perceptions from their stores at the same time. Its doctrine reduces all existence to one hundred elements (法 dharmas) into five divisions, namely, mind, mental function, material, not concomitant with mind and unconditioned, dharmas. According to this school, the external world is created when the a^laya (storehouse) consciousness is influenced ('perfumated') 薰 by "seeds" or effects of good and evil deeds. Another important contribution of the Consciousness-only thinkers was that of the three natures of imaginary, provisional and real. 【参照: 三性】  The major framework of Consciousness-only theory was developed by Maitreya 弥勒 and the two brothers Vasubandhu 世亲 and Asan%ga 无著 in such treatises as the Abdhidharma-ko/sa-bha^sya 俱舍论, the Trim!/sika^ Vijn~aptima^trata^siddhih! (Thirty Verses on Consciousness-only) 唯识三十颂, Maha^ya^na-sam!graha 摄大乘论, and the Yoga^ca^rabhu^mi-/sa^stra 瑜伽师地论. Consciousness-only doctrine was also defined in sutras such as the Sam!dhinirmocana-su^tra and S/ri^ma^la^-su^tra 胜□经. The Maha^ya^na-sam!graha, for example, says "All conscious objects are only constructs of consciousness because there are no external objects. They are like a dream" (如此众识唯识 以无尘等故 譬如梦等) 〔摄大乘论 T 1593.31.118b12〕(Keenan 1992: 40).The Weishi sanshi lun; Trim!sika^ (Thirty Verses on Vijn~apti-ma^tra Treatise) Vasubandhu 世亲1586 Translated by Xuanzang 玄奘 in 648 at Hongfu Monastery. This is the root text on which the Cheng weishi lun 成唯识论 expounds. The Chinese title would literally translate into Sanskrit as Trim!sika^-vijn~apti-ma^tra /sa^stra. This is a basic work for East Asian Yoga^ca^ra, as it articulates the most basic doctrines such as the production of conditioned phenomena 有为法 from the a^layavijn~a^na 阿赖耶识, and teaches how illusion is eliminated in the attainment of enlightenment. Translated in Lusthaus (2000). Other translations, from Sanskrit, found in Anacker (1984) and Kochumuttom (1982).Wei-shih san-shih lun sung; the Trim!/sika^ Vijn~aptima^trata^siddhih!

Since Vasubandhu passed away without having ever written explanatory commentary on these verses, succeeding generations of scholars engaged in extensive debate over their interpretation, to the extent that various schools of Yoga^ca^ra developed. Among these interpretations, it was that by Dharmapa^la 护法 which came to be taken as orthodox. This commentary by Dharmapa^la formed the major content of the Vijn~aptima^trata^siddhi-/sa^stra, which was translated into Chinese by Xuanzang 玄奘 as the Cheng weishi lun 成唯识论, in turn an important text in the formation of the Chinese Faxiang school 法相宗.

The Consciousness-only (Weishi zong, Yusik chong)sect of Buddhism, which holds to the belief that all things exist as nothing but consciousness. 【参照: 唯识派】The Consciousness-only school of thought, which took as its major tenet the concept that the experienced world is nothing other than the manifestation of our own consciousness. This basic view of the world formed the cornerstone of the doctrines of the Yoga^ca^ra school 瑜伽行派 in India as well as the "Dharma-characteristic" sects 法相宗 of East Asia, and therefore the term "School of Consciousness-only" is regularly used to refer to either one of these sects. The Yoga^ca^ra 瑜伽行派 school of Indian Buddhism, which together with the Middle Way (Ma^dhyamika; 中观派) school, represented one of the two main branches of Maha^ya^na philosophy. Its great teachers in India were Asan%ga (fourth century CE) 无著?无著 and his brother Vasubandhu 世亲. When Asan%ga's works were first translated into Chinese in the sixth century CE, the school was known as Shelun 摄论宗, but eventually it was absorbed into the school of the great Chinese translator-monk Hsuan-tsang 玄奘 (596-664). Hsuan-tsang's school was known as the Fa-hsiang ('dharma-characteristic') school, after this main feature of its teachings.The one hundred elements (dharmas) outlined by the Consciousness-only school.(1) Prajn~a^ruci's 般若流支 translation of Vasubandhu's Vim!/satika^ vijn~apti-ma^trata^-siddhih!.

Born into a royal family of Orissa, he inherited the throne at age thirteen, but renounced it when his brothers began a violent struggle over the succession. He became a Buddhist monk, settling in the Ven!uvanaviha^ra 竹林精舍 at Na^landa monastery 那烂陀寺. At the behest of his master Dharmagupta 达磨掬多, he embarked on a journey to China via Turfan 吐蕃, arriving in 716. He was met by the emperor Xuanzong 玄宗 in 717, and began translating texts at Siming temple. When the emperor relocated in 724, he moved to Tafusien temple at Loyang, working there with Yixing 一行 on the translation of the Vairocana^bhisambodhi 大日经 (T 848). Though best known for translating that work, he translated a number of important esoteric texts such as the Susiddhi 苏悉地经 (T 894) as well. He also performed rituals for the state and gave lectures; some of these are recorded in 'Master S/ubha's Guide to Meditation' 无畏三藏禅要 (T 917). Another text drafted in China under his guidance, the iconographic 'Essential Meditations on the Five Families' 五部心观, carries a portrait of S/ubhakara^sim!h!a.

Each stage is seen as having two aspects: that of ascent into the stage, indicated by 向, and consummation of the stage, indicated by 果. The stream-enterer succeeds in eradicating conceptual disturbances 见惑 of the three realms (also called the eighty-eight defilements 八十八使), experiences the fifteen minds 十五心 of the Path of Seeing 见道, and finishing this task, enters the Path of Cultivation 修道, thus consummating this stage. Entering into the stage of once-returner, the practitioner removes the first six of the nine qualities 九品 of afflictions removable in the Path of Cultivation 修惑and thus consummates this stage.

(maha^-bhu^ta). The 'four gross elements.' 'Gross' (大) means 'element,' which all substances are composed of. These are: (1) tu 土 the earth element (prthivi^ dha^tu), which has the basic quality of hardness and the function of protection; (2) shui 水 water (ab-dha^tu), which has the function of gathering and storing wetness; (3) 火 fire (teja-dha^tu), which is the nature of heat and has the function of warming; (4) feng 风 wind (va^yu^-dha^tu), which has the function of giving life to all living things. It is thought that when these are gathered, material substance is produced; therefore they are called the 'forms of creatability.' In India, there are other transmissions of ideology whose explanations resemble this one, and even within Buddhism there are other explanations, but in the explanation of Abhidharma Buddhism, the objects of consciousness of earth, wind, fire and water are provisional elements, since the true elements are imperceptible.The four continents make up the world in which humans, animals, etc exist.

The title of each of the Four Thoughts is extracted from a verse of Asan%ga's Ode to the Diamond Sutra (T1514), of which the Vasubandhu commentary is an annotation. This exegetical scheme used by Vasubandhu is usually found summarized in the Chinese exegetical texts. The Four Thoughts, and the passages they refer to are (using Bodhiruci's translation, T236/T1511):  1) The 'Broadly Extensive Thought' (广大心). Corresponds to: "诸菩萨生如是心。所有一切众生众生所摄 ..." to .".. 所有众生界众生所摄。" (T236.8.753a1-4)  2) The 'Supreme Thought' (第一心). Corresponds to: "我皆令入无余涅盘而灭度之。" (T236.8.753a4-5)  3) The 'Eternal Thought' (常心). Corresponds to: "如是灭度无量无边众生实无众生得灭度者。何以故。 须菩提。若菩萨有众生相即非菩萨。" (T236.8.753a1-7) Vasubandhu comments that the living beings are not different from the bodhisattva's own self, and so if a bodhisattva conceives of the living beings as being separate from himself then he is not a bodhisattva. "Thusly apprehending the myriad beings as his own body, the eternal is not abandoned." (T1511.25.782a)  4) The 'Undeluded Thought' (不颠倒). Corresponds to: "何以故非。须菩提。若菩萨起众生相人相寿者相。 则不名菩萨。" (T236.8.753a7-8) Vasubandhu comments: "This makes plain the distant separation (of the bodhisattva) from, and accordingly the cessation of, a self which views the images of myriad beings, etc." (T 1511.25.782a) It should be noted that one must use a translation of the Diamond Sutra other than Kuma^raji^va's to follow the fourfold division, as Kuma^raji^va does not include the final conclusion to this section of the sutra. The commentary by Vasubandhu was translated into Chinese by Bodhiruci 菩提流支 (T1511-金刚般若波罗蜜经论) and Yijing 义净 (T1513-能断金刚般若波罗蜜多经论释), and those two versions of the Diamond Sutra are used in each respectively. Yijing also extracted Asan%ga's Ode from a separate text (T1514).The 'four stations (or bases) of mindfulness'; also; the fourfold contemplation to be practiced after one has completed the exercise of tranquilizing one's mind: (1) shennianzhu 身念住, contemplating one's body as defiled; (2) shounianzhu 受念住, contemplating one's feelings as painful: even though there are agreeable sensations, they are deceptive, and there is no true pleasure in the world; (3) xinnianzhu 心念住, contemplating one's mind as constantly changing and (4) fanianzhu 法念住, contemplating things in general as devoid of inherent existence. The four bases of mindfulness are included in the thirty-seven elements of enlightenment (三十七道品). Also written 四念处.'Four Mindfulnesses.'

Preaching which accords to the conventional understanding of the world. (2) gegeweirenxitan 各各为人悉檀 Siddha^nta for each individual. Preaching according to the abilities and levels of understanding of the people listening. (3) duizhixitan 对治悉檀 Special application siddha^nta. Preaching aimed at destroying strong defilement or evil karma of certain beings. (4) diyiyixitan 第一义悉檀 Siddha^nta of supreme truth.

In the Nirva^na-su^tra these are: impermanence, suffering, no-self and impurity.Four kinds of fundamental afflictions: (1) Self-ignorance 我痴, self-view 我见, self-pride 我慢 and self-love 我爱. These are understood to be originated in the manas consciousness 末那识.The "four raging currents."

A twelve fascicle work by Zhiyi 智□, the founder of Tiantai Buddhism. This treatise is devoted to the detailed and systematic exposition of the Four Teachings (one of the schemes by which the Buddhist sutras and treatises are arranged in the Tiantai tenet classification system). The four teachings are: (1) sancang 三藏the Tripitaka teaching; (2) tong 通 the Pervasive or 'shared' teaching; (3) bie 别 the Distinct teaching and (4) yuan 圆 the Complete teaching. Originally it formed a part of his commentary on the Vimalaki^rti-nirde/sa-su^tra 维摩经, which he finished in 595 C.E.To be disoriented; to lose one's sense of direction. A simile which appears in Buddhist scriptures to describe the nature of ignorance. See, for example in the Sutra of Perfect Enlightenment 圆觉经 (T 842.17.913b22), in the Awakening of Faith 起信论 (T 1666.38.577a3 ff. and 579c23) and in the S/u^ram!gama-su^tra 首楞严经 (T 945.19.120b21-23).The 'four forms of fearlessness' (catva^ri-vaisaradyani). Four types of fearlessness, or utter conviction, in preaching the dharma. I. Those of a buddha are: (1) zhengdengjue wuwei 正等觉无畏, fearlessness in asserting that he has attained perfect enlightenment; (2) louyongjin wuwei 漏永尽无畏, fearlessness in asserting that he has destroyed all defilements; (3) shuozhangfa wuwei 说障法无畏, fearlessness in showing people those elements which hinder the realization of the Dharma, and (4) shuochudao wuwei 说出道无畏, fearlessness in expounding the method of liberation.

(3) The four kinds of wisdom that cut off delusion. These are: the wisdom that extinguishes the production of selfhood; the wisdom of establishing pure works; the wisdom of doing what should be done; the wisdom that keeps this existence from being reborn.The four raging currents--a synonym for the four kinds of outflow 四漏 (Skt. catva^ra ogha^h!, catur-ogha; Pali catta^ro-ogha^).

Four progressively subtle stages of meditation which lead one out from the desire realm into rebirth in the four meditation heavens 四禅天 in the realm of form 色界 (catur-dhya^na). (1) In the first meditation the practitioner experiences the joy and pleasure of abandoning coarse desires 离生喜乐; (2) in the second, one dwells solely in the joy and pleasure produced by meditation 定生喜乐; (3) in the third, one attains sublime pleasure that transcends ordinary joy 离喜妙乐, and (4) in the fourth, one dwells in a state of mental stability free from various sensations of pain and pleasure 非苦非乐.The 'four meditation heavens' in the realm of form. The four spheres one is born into depending upon one's level of meditation practice in the four meditative concentrations 四禅. There are various sources which describe these, but one of the most extensive is the Abhidharmako/sa-bha^sya 俱舍论, where they are discussed in connection with the term 四静虑; the Zen gaku jiten cites a text called the Jietuodao lun 解脱道论. Those who practice the first meditative concentration in the present lifetime are born in the first meditation heaven into one of three different levels according to their proficiency in practice. Those of the lower level are born into heaven of Brahma followers 梵众天; those of middling level are born into the heaven of Brahma's ministers 梵辅天 and those of the superior level are born into the great Brahma heaven 大梵天. In similar fashion, those who practice the second meditation in the present life are born into three grades of heavens according to their proficiency in practice: the heaven of limited light 少光天; the heaven of limitless light 无量光天 and the heaven of ultimate light and purity 极光净天. In the third heaven there are again three: the heaven of limited purity 少净天, the heaven of limitless purity 无量净天 and the heaven of pervasive purity 遍净天. The fourth heaven has eight levels: the first three of these, the cloudless heaven 无云天 the heaven of blessed birth 福生天 and the heaven of extensive fruition 广果天 are attainable by unenlightened sentient beings; the final five are attained only by Buddhist saints who have consummated the undefiled concentration of the fourth level: these are the heaven of no affliction 无烦天, the heaven of no heat 无热天, the heaven of skillful manifestation 善现天, the heaven of skillful vision 善见天, and the heaven of ultimate form 色究竟天. 〔俱舍论、 T 1558.29.41a〕The four meditations of the form realm. 【参照: 四禅】【参照: 四智】 〔二障义 HPC 1.806a7〕The "four kinds of view of a self:" (1) The view of a self arising from discrimination 有分别我见, which is arisen by those who perceive reality in a non-Buddhist manner; (2) the view of a self arisen in the process of coming to be born 俱生我见, which can be arisen by animals as well as human beings; (3) the view of self arisen by each person based on his understanding of himself 自依止我见 and (4) the view of self which arises in dependence on one's relationship with others 缘他依止我见.〔瑜伽论T 1579.30.779c10-14〕The four kinds of prediction of Buddhahood. In the Shoulengyan sanmei jing 首楞严三昧经 these are: (1) The prediction for those who have not yet arisen the mind of enlightenment. (2) The prediction for those who are at the point of arising the mind of enlightenment. (3) The secret prediction. (4) The prediction for those who have attained the level of unarisen tolerance.

In the teachings of the Yoga^ca^ra school, nirva^na is divided into four types. The first is the nirva^na of the originally pure self-nature, the original thusness of all existence. The second refers to the thusness expressed in the extinction of the hindrances due to defilement, and is called "nirva^na with remainder." The third is "nirva^na without remainder"; in this nirva^na the hindrances due to defilement in the mind are cut off, and the body in which the five skandhas was united is extinguished. In the fourth, both the hindrances due to defilement and the hindrances of knowing are cut off, and a deep wisdom is attained wherein sam!sa^ra and nirva^na are not distinguished. Not abiding in nirva^na nor disliking sam!sa^ra, one teaches sentient beings yet does not become attached to the world. This condition of complete separation from delusion is called "nirva^na with no abode."The four kinds of afflictions related to the view of self, which are concomitant with the manas (seventh) consciousness 末那识. They are self 我 and its three functions of view of person 萨迦耶见, self-pride 我慢, and self-love 我爱. Same as 任运烦恼. 〔瑜伽论 T 1579.30.651c21〕The four kinds of errors according to Wonhyo 元晓 in his commentary on the Awakening of Faith 起信论. Belief in existence; belief in non-existence; belief in both; belief in neither.Four kinds of hindrances taught in the Ratnagotravibha^ga. The hindrance of the marks of conditions 缘相, the hindrance of the marks of causes 因相, the hindrance of the marks of arising 生相, and the hindrance of the marks of destruction 坏相. 〔宝性论T 1611.31.830b2-10〕Four kinds of errors; which are four kinds of inverted understandings of reality: perceiving permanence when one should perceive impermanence; perceiving a self when one should perceive no-self; perceiving pleasure when one should be perceiving suffering and perceiving purity when one should be perceiving impurity. 〔宝性论T 1611.31.813a-848a〕【参照: 四无色】The 'four locations in the formless realm.' Four spheres of existence within the formless realm. Also written siwushi 四无色. Those who practice the four formless concentrations are born here. 【参照: 四无色】【参照: 四无色】【参照: 阿弥陀经】'four conditions', 'four causes.' {I} In the Consciousness-only 唯识 school, a broad division into four types, of the causes that produce all things. In this case, the ideograph yuan 缘 has the meaning of yin 因. This classification is used especially in explaining the "nature of dependent arising 依他起性." The explanation of the relationship of these four causes to the "six causes" 六因 differs between Consciousness-only and Abhidharma-ko/sa. The four are: (1) yinyuan 因缘 (hetu-pratyaya) a direct internal cause that produces a result. Refers to newly producing the fruit of a person--seeds and their manifestation. The production by the seeds in the a^laya Consciousness of the world cognized through the seven consciousnesses. (2) dengwujianyuan 等无间缘 (sam!anantara-pratyaya) Since the prior instant of mind/mental functioning gives rise directly to the succeeding instant of mind, there is no gap in their leading into one another. Also called cidiyuan 次第缘. (3) suoyuanyuan 所缘缘 'Object as condition' (a^lambana-pratyaya). For the mind to arise, its object must be present, so every object becomes a cause for the mind. These objects are discriminated into the two types of 亲 and 疏. (4) zengshangyuan 增上缘 (adhipati-pratyaya) 'Causes beyond direct empowerment.' This group includes all indirect causes outside the above three. Not only those things which give power to the production of results, but things which merely do not impede or hinder. {II} In the Sutra of Perfect Enlightenment 圆觉经, the Four Elements (四大). {III} In the Vajrasam!a^dhi-su^tra, the four causes are: (1) 作择灭力取缘; (2) 本利根净所集起缘; (3) 本慧大悲力缘; (4) 一觉通智力缘. (T vol. 9, p. 370c)The four basic forms of suffering; see next 四苦八苦.The four and eight kinds of suffering taught by S/a^kyamuni in his exposition of the Four Noble Truths 四谛. These include the four basic forms of suffering: birth 生, aging 老, sickness 病 and death 死, along with the four derivative forms of suffering: separation from that which we love 爱别离苦, association with that which we hate 怨憎会苦, Ina-Zbility to fulfill our desires 求不得苦 and the suffering from the instability of the five skandhas 五阴盛苦. Since there are eight forms of suffering in total, they are often referred to more simply as such 八苦. 〔瑜伽论T 1579.30.289b〕'Four crossings.' An intersection (Huayan Wu jiao zhang). Another term for the Four Noble Truths.(1) Four perspectives, four views, four understandings. For example, to a human being, water is something to drink; to a fish, it is the surrounding environment, to the gods it is a jewel, and to a hungry ghost it is bloody pus. (2) Equivalent to "four phrases"--【参照: 四句】 (3) In Yoga^ca^ra, the four kinds of attached views held by non-Buddhists that are associated with the manas consciousness 末那识: the view of existence of the person 有身见; the view of attachment to extremes 边执见; evil view 邪见, and view of attachment to views 见取见. These are the same as the five views 五见, without the view of attachment to precepts. (4) In the Sanlun 三论 doctrine, four kinds of attachment associated with four kinds of teaching.Same as four bases of mindfulness 四念处.The "four noble truths" (a^rya-satya) which form the main content of the Buddha's first sermon given at Ba^ra^n!asi^: the truth of suffering (duh!kha) 苦谛, the truth of the arising of suffering (samudaya) 集谛, the truth of the cessation of suffering (nirodha) 灭谛, and the truth of the path to the cessation of suffering (ma^rga) 道谛.

(2) The path of non-obstruction 无间道-- the stage where defilements are destroyed by the awakening of correct wisdom.

According to legend, Gautama Siddhartha, becoming frustrated with his lack of experience with the world outside of his father's castle, eventually forced his father to allow him to travel outside. Despite the efforts of his father's retainers to clear the roadways of any problematic scenes, Gautama witnessed on four trips, a sick person, an extremely aged person, a corpse and a religious mendicant (/sraman!a). These experiences catalyzed his determination to renounce his worldly life and seek enlightenment.Same as 四门出游.The 'four stages in the attainment of buddhahood': (1) The myriad practices of the three great incalculable eons; (2) The hundred kalpas practice of good marks; (3) The cutting off of doubts in the first eight bhu^mi; (4) Sitting in meditation and arising the 34 mindfulnesses to cut off all non-conceptual doubts and become a Buddha.A later rendering of the Sanskrit catur-dhya^na, meaning "four meditations." This is a later period translation for what was originally rendered as si chanding 四禅定.The 'four falls'; four inverted views, which cause one to fall from the true path (viparya^sa-catuksa). They are: (1) the fall of permanence--taking the impermanent to be permanent; (2) Enjoyment--perceiving suffering as enjoyment; (3) Purity-- seeing the impure as pure; (4) Self--perceiving what is not a self to be a self. These can be found in the Vimalaki^rti-nirde/sa-su^tra 维摩经, as well as the Abhidharmako/sa-bha^sya 俱舍论. Other texts list different groups of these four.The four kinds of food.

One of the five Zen temples in Kamakura. In the ages of Bun-ei and Koan, Japan was attacked twice by Mongolia. It was the most unprecedented national crisis Japan ever met. Executive Tokimune Hojo, who had long embraced Zen, profoundly carried out his daily study of Zen even during the dangerous period of Koan. Wuxue zuyuan (Bukko^ Kokushi佛光国师) was the Chan master from China whom the executive looked up to. The Japanese nation engaged the formidable enemy as a whole and beat back the Mongolians. After this, Tokimune wished not only to spread the way of Zen that remained his mental support all the while, but to hold a mass for the souls, of both Japanese and Mongolian soldiers who laid down their life in those wars. He also wanted to express his gratitude to his master Bukko^. Thus, the building of a temple was envisioned. The temple was given the name of engaku after Engaku-Kyo (Sutra of Perfect Enlightenment 圆觉经), dug out of the selected building site, in a stone chest.            The establishment of Bukko^ sect was succeeded from Ko^ho^ Ken-nichi 高峰显日 of Nasu Ungen-ji to Muso Soseki 梦窗疏石 of Tenryu^-ji 天龙寺. Especially Muso was respected as 'the master of seven emperors' in the era of Northern and Southern Dynasties (1336-1392). His school formed the major influence of the Zen world of Japan in the Muromachi Era (1338-1573). The temple encountered fire several times. It also experienced temporary decline. However, Priest Seisetsu 诚拙 appeared at the end of the Edo Era (1603-1867) and reconstructed the monastery to consolidate the foundation of the present Engaku-ji. He maintained the austere atmosphere for trainees, carrying out the reform of the sect.            In the Meiji Era (1868-1912), itinerant and laity trainees, called koji 居士, learned Zen under the direction of Imakita Kosen and his disciple Shaku So^en 释宗演. The temple became the center of Zen in the Kanto Area. From the zazen course for students at Kojirin, outstanding men of ability appeared in great numbers in its long proud history. Engaku-ji runs zazen circles of various kinds and summer courses open for the public. Engaku-ji has eighteen branch temples in its site in addition to Jo^chi-ji 净智寺, To^kei-ｊi 东庆寺, and Zuisen-ji 瑞泉寺 nearby.Yuanjue jing; the Sutra of Perfect Enlightenment; 1 fasc., (T 842.17.913a-922a). Full title Dafangguang yuanjue xiuduluo liaoyi jing 大方广圆觉修多罗了义经 (SPE). A Chinese Maha^ya^na sutra which was probably written in the early eighth century C.E. Divided into twelve chapters as a series of discussions on meditation practice, this text deals with issues such as the meaning and origin of ignorance, sudden and gradual enlightenment, original Buddhahood, etc., all themes which were originally elucidated in the Awakening of Faith 起信论. It was intended to resolve questions regarding doctrine and meditation for the earliest practitioners of the Chan school. The original popularization of the SPE in China is in large part due to the efforts of Zongmi (宗密; 780-841), who commented on this scripture extensively. His commentaries on this text include: (1) Yuanjue jing da shou 圆觉经大疏. (Great Commentary on the Sutra of Perfect Enlightenment) 12 fasc. Z 243.9.324a-418b.

The sutra became even more popular in the Korean Son tradition where it was a favorite text of Chinul 知讷 and was also explicated by Hamho Tukt'ong (涵虚得通) in his Won'gakkyong sorui 圆觉经说谊. The sutra became a basic text in the Korean monastic educational system.  The Sutra of Perfect Enlightenment is closely related in content to other East Asian works such as the Awakening of Faith (大乘起信论), the S/u^rangama-su^tra (首楞严经), and the Compilation of Yongjia (永嘉集). Translated into English by Luk (1962) and Muller (1999).

The original Indic terms of naraka and niraya (Sanskrit and Pali) are transliterated into Chinese as 奈落 (那落) and 泥黎 respectively. It is considered as one of the three evil destinies 三恶道 (三恶趣) five destinies 五趣, six destinies 六道, and ten realms 十界. The scriptures have extensive categories and lists of the hells, among the most well-known are the eight hot hells 八热地狱 (八大地狱) and eight cold hells 八寒地狱 that extend between the sam!ji^va 等活 and avi^ci 阿鼻 hells, which are all part of the primary hells 根本地狱. These also have secondary, or adjacent hells attached to them. A third class of hells are the "isolated" hells 孤地狱 in the mountains, deserts, below and above the earth. The composition of and relationship between the hells is explained in detail in such scriptures as the Abhidharmako/sa-bha^sya 俱舍论. As one might expect, this extensive theory of hells developed over a long period of time, based on numerous sources and influences in Indian religion. All of the Buddhist dictionaries listed in the references for this entry contain extensive detail regarding the lists and attributes of the hells.The Dizang shilun jing; Da/sa-cakra-ks!itigarbha su^tra (Ten Cakras of Ks!itigarbha, Maha^ya^na Great Collection Sutra).

T 412.13.777c-790a.Dilun 【参照: 十地经论】The Dilun zong: in English, the Stages Sect, or School of the Treatise on the Bhu^mis. One of the earlier schools of Chinese Buddhism, which was based on the commentary written by Vasubandhu 世亲 on the Da/sabhu^mika-/sa^stra (Shidijing lun 十地经论), which also forms the commentary on one chapter of the Huayan jing 华严经. Ratnamati 勒那摩提 and Bodhiruci 菩提流支 brought the manuscript of the Da/sabhu^mi-vya^khya^na and translated it into Chinese during the Northern Wei dynasty. The Dilun school was based primarily on Yoga^ca^ra philosophy 瑜伽行派, particularly theories of the a^layavijn~a^na 阿赖耶识. The northern branch of the school, represented by Bodhiruci's student Daochong 道宠, took the position that the storehouse consciousness is not real, and that buddha-nature is first acquired on attaining buddhahood, thus it is not inborn. The southern school, represented by Ratnamati's student Huiguang 慧光, saw the a^layavijn~a^na as real and identical with the inborn buddha-nature 佛性. The Huayan school 华严宗 is said to have developed out of the southern branch, while Faxiang 法相宗 absorbed the northern branch.Kyunyo (923-973), an influential Hwaom 华严 scholar of the Koryo period. He commented prolifically on the works of the Chinese Huayan patriarchs, and lay the ground for the future rapprochement of Hwaom and Son by his accommodating attitude stance toward the latter. His works are an important source for modern scholarship in terms of identifying the distinctive nature of Korean Hwaom.

It is a school of Buddhism prevalent in China, Korea, Japan, Mongolia, Tibet and other places in the Far East. It is also called Northern Buddhism.   Mahayana is described as seeking Buddhahood and transforming beings, thus self-benefiting for the benefits of the others.
"Great vehicle." A translation of the Sanskrit term maha^ya^na, the name attached to a late Indian sectarian movement which was to become extremely influential later in East Asia. The term was developed together with the disparaging hi^naya^na 小乘, which was used by the former group to distinguish the two. In the polemical sense, the concept of "great vehicle" is intended to refer to the fact that the group considered their doctrines to be more open and universalistic in terms of advocating that enlightenment was something which was attainable by all sentient beings, rather than just by monks and nuns who practiced in the pure environment of the monastery. The Maha^ya^na movement produced a large body of new sutras, in which their new model practitioner, the bodhisattva 菩萨, preached the doctrine of the emptiness 空 of all things. The schools which considered themselves to be Maha^ya^na (Ma^dhyamika 中观派, Yoga^ca^ra 瑜伽行派, etc.) were to predominate in the transmission to East Asia, and therefore the later schools which were formed in East Asia also considered themselves as heir to the Maha^ya^na teachings.Dasheng yizhang; (Essay on the Meaning of Maha^ya^na). 26 fasc., by Huiyuan 慧远; T 1851.44.465a-875c.The Dasheng wuyun lun (Pan~caskandhaka-prakaran!a; Maha^ya^na Treatise on the Five Skandhas); T 1612.31.848-850.

According to some traditions, the verses were written by Maitreyan 弥勒, and were expanded into prose form by Asan%ga 无著, or his brother Vasubandhu 世亲. Translated in to Chinese by Prabha^karamitra 波罗颇蜜多罗 during 630-633. There is also a Tibetan translation.  It is an important text for the Yoga^ca^ra school 瑜伽行派, being one of the eleven treatises on which the Cheng weishi lun 成唯识论 is based. It is comprised of twenty-four chapters, the content of which are almost exactly the same as that of the Chapter of the Bodhisattva Stages in the Yoga^ca^rabhu^mi-/sa^stra 瑜伽论, with the most important discussions being in regard to: the bodhisattvas seeds 种姓, arousal of intention to save sentient beings 发心, faith and understanding 信解, six perfections 六波罗蜜, and the merits of practice 功德. Commonly abbreviated as Zhuangyan lun 庄严论.

The focus of this treatise is on articulation of the action of karma 业. It is explained that the karma created by physical action, speech, and thought is superficial compared to the situation when the a^layavijn~a^na 阿赖耶识 stores seeds of affliction. This is an intermediate work of Vasubandhu that shows how his ideas were developing since writing the Ko/sa 俱舍论 but not yet thinking like a Yoga^ca^rin.

Explanatory tantra based on the second and third sections of the Tattvasam!graha (T 882). Chiefly concerned with the salvation of those who have been reborn in hostile realms, it is the primary text for funerary rites in Tibet and Nepal. In the Tibetan canon, there are two types of Sarvadurgatipari/sodhana-tantra; Faxian's translation corresponds to the text also called Tantra of the Nine Buddhos!n!i^s!as (gtsug dgu'i rgyud) (To.483, P.116). This version cites verses from the Suba^huparipr!ccha^ (T 895) and Vairocana-abhisam!bodhi (T 848), and is indebted to yogatantras such as the Vajrodaya. The other version is called the Purification Tantra (sbyong rgyud).  Indian commentaries in Tibetan are authored by Buddhaguhya (To.2624; P. 3451), Ka^madhenu (To.2625; P.2452), and a^nandagarbha (To.2626; P.4353).

Written from the perspective of essence and function (tiyong 体用), this text sought to harmonize the two Indian-derived soteriological positions of the tatha^gatagarbha and a^layavijn~a^na systems into a synthetic vision based on the One Mind in Two Aspects. The Awakening of Faith was to become one of the singlemost influential texts in the development of the East Asian style of Buddha-nature theory. It was studied and commented on repeatedly by a long list of East Asian scholars, including such luminaries as Wonhyo 元晓, Fazang 法藏 and Zongmi 宗密. Although its authorship is attributed to the Indian monk A/svaghos!a 马鸣, modern scholarship is fairly certain that the text was an indigenous East Asian production. In great part due to the commentaries by Wonhyo 元晓, the Awakening of Faith ended up having an unusually powerful influence in Korea, where it may be the most oft-cited text in the entire tradition.Dasheng qixin lun yishou; 4 fasc., by Huiyuan 慧远.

They are also known to be associated with lay practice movements, and therefore considered to be a forerunner of the Maha^ya^na movement.The Da foding datuoluoni; see Da fo ding ru lai fanggua^ng Xi^da duo^bo^da luo tuo lu ne 大佛顶如来放光悉怛多钵怛陀罗尼.The S/u^ram!gama-su^tra (Da foding rulai miyin xiuzheng liaoyi zhupusa wanxing shoulengyan jing). 【参照: 首楞严经】The Da foding rulai fangguang Xidaduobodaluo tuoluoni; Skt.

(1) With respect to its nature (自性异) , ordinary compassion is absence of hatred, whereas the great compassion is absence of ignorance. (2) With respect to its aspect (行相异), ordinary compassion takes on the form of one suffering, the ordinary suffering, whereas the great compassion takes on the form of threefold suffering. (3) With respect to its object (所缘异), ordinary compassion is concerned with the beings of one ka^ma-dha^tu 欲界 only, whereas the great compassion is concerned with the three dha^tus 三界. (4) With respect to its sphere (bhu^mi) (依地异) , ordinary compassion is of the sphere of the ten dhya^nas: the four dhya^nas, the four stages cross to the four dhya^nas, middle and the ka^ma-bhu^mi, whereas the great compassion is of the sphere of the fourth dhya^na only. (5) With respect to its support (依身异) , ordinary compassion arises in /sra^vakas, pratyekabuddhas, buddhas as well as sentient beings (pr!thagjanas), whereas the great compassion arises only in the Buddha. (6) With respect to its acquisition (证得异), ordinary compassion is obtained through detachment from ka^ma-dha^tu and the third dhya^na, whereas the great compassion is obtained through detachment from bhavagra only. (7) With respect to its saving (others) (救济异), ordinary compassion only gives rise to the sympathy for the act of saving (others), whereas the great compassion gives rise to the sympathy and accomplishes the act of saving. (8) With respect to compassion (哀愍异), ordinary compassion is an unequal compassion, for it sympathizes only with beings who are suffering, whereas the great compassion is an equal compassion, turned towards beings equally. 〔大毗婆沙论卷三十一、卷八十三、俱舍论卷二十七〕Great afflictions--the primary afflictions 根本烦恼. 【参照: 大小二惑】The drift of, the scope of, outline.Great kindness; great compassion; great mercy (maha^-maitri^). 〔法华经 T 262.9.23b21〕Great wisdom; supreme wisdom.

"The Great Sun Buddha, is the transcendent and cosmocratic apotheosis of the historical Buddha, Sakyamuni. Under the earlier designation Vairocana ("the luminous one"), he represents Buddhism's most profound speculation on the emptiness and interpenetration of all elements in the universe (dharmadha^tu). As Maha^vairocana he is concretely envisaged as the all-encompassing lord of the cosmos and is the object of worship for a form of Tantric Buddhism that spread from India to Sumatra, China, Japan, and Tibet." (Encyclopedia of Religion, Orzech). Originally the name referred to the light of the sun, but later on took on connotations of the buddha as fundamental principle of the universe. He is one of the five buddhas 五佛 depicted in the man!d!alas of the vajradha^tu and garbhadha^tu. The name is transcribed into Chinese as 摩诃毗卢遮那 and 毗卢遮那佛, and is translated variously as 最高显广眼藏, 遍照王如来, 光明遍照, 大日遍照, 遍一切处, 遍照尊.The abbreviated title for Maha^vairocana^bhisam!bodhi-vikurvita^dhis!t!ha^na-vaipulyasu^tra, the Chinese translation of the Da piluzhena chengfo shenbian jiachi jing 大毗卢遮那成佛神变加持经 (T 848.18.1-55), which became the most important text for the East Asian Vajraya^na/Tantraya^na school.

T.848.18.1-55, 7 fasc., translated by Subha^karasim!ha 善无畏 with the assistance of Yixing 一行 in 724; commonly abbreviated as Vairocana^bhisam!bodhi 大日经. The primary theme of this work, which is of utmost importance in East Asian esotericism, is the realization of the mind seeking enlightenment 菩提心. This theme is addressed in the opening dialogue between Maha^vairocana 大日如来 and an assembly led by Vajrapa^n!i 执金刚秘密主, who inquires about omniscient knowledge (sarvajn~a^jn~a^na 一切智智). The Bhagavan responds that "it is caused by the mind which seeks enlightenment, is founded on sympathy for others, and culminates in skilful methods" (karun!a^mu^lam! bodhicittahetukam upa^yaparyavasa^nam 悲为根本。菩提心为因。方便为究竟). Enlightenment is defined as "knowing one's mind for what it really is" 谓如实知自心, and subsequent chapters are devoted to describing the skilful methods 方便 for its accomplishment. Foremost among these methods is entrance into the man!d!ala born from great compassion (maha^karun!a^garbhodbhava-man!d!ala 大悲胎藏生曼荼罗), described at length in chapter two, The Relevant Equipment 具缘品.' Later chapters deal with the entire gamut of esoteric techniques: the practice of mantras 真言, the fire ceremony (homa 护摩), the wheel of syllables (aks!a^racakra 字轮), meditation on the stu^pa of five cakras 五轮塔, and so on. However, unlike many previous esoteric works, in this text such techniques are almost exclusively oriented towards the accomplishment (siddhi 成就) of enlightenment rather than worldly goals. Many early sources for these esoteric practices have been established: for example, the three-family (kula 部) system can be found in the Dha^ran!i^samuccaya 陀罗尼集经, and its man!d!ala is indebted to the Vajrapa^n!yabhis!eka-tantra 金刚手灌顶续 (To.496). It is likely that the original text was composed in the mid-seventh century CE, when esotericism gained the status of legitimate "hot topic" among Buddhist monastics in India. while a Sanskrit version has never been found, fragments have been located in diverse sources: the Kriya^sam!graha (To.2531), the Indonesian Sang Hyang Kamaha^ya^nan Mantranaya, the Bha^vana^krama, and the Pradi^poddyotana.  The Chinese text is based on a manuscript recovered from the belongings of the pilgrim Wuxing 无行 (d.674), which, as with many tantras, is said to have been a condensed version (laghutantra 略本) abridged from a lengthy original (mu^latantra 广本) of 100,000 verses 迦陀.  An ambitious attempt at reconstructing the Sanskrit was made by Jiun 慈云 (1718-1804), who made use of citations in the principal Chinese commentary, the Darijingshu 大日经疏 (T.1796). This exhaustive and accessible commentary, along with a well-maintained ritual tradition, have contributed greatly to the text's continuing importance in the Japanese esoteric schools. By contrast, it seems to have attracted little attention in Tibet, where it was translated no later than the early ninth century by S/i^lendrabodhi and dPal-brtegs. Lucid and generous commentaries by the eighth-century pandit Buddhaguhya 佛密 (Sangs-rgyas-gsang-ba), such as the Vairocana-abhisambodhitantrapin!d!artha (To.2662, P.3486), were also translated into Tibetan. For scholastics such as mKhas-grub-rje 智法祖师 (1385-1438) the text's most noteworthy feature is its advocacy of a yoga without semiosis (animittayoga 无相三昧, mtshan ma med pa'i rnal byor), a practice which qualifies its preeminent rank among the ca^rya 行 tantras in the Tibetan classification. The sequence of chapters in the Chinese and Tibetan editions differs slightly, suggesting that in later times chapters were reordered in accordance with exegetical tradition. Correspondences between chapter numbers are as follows: 1-5:1-5, 6+7:6, 8-12:10-14, 13:16, 14:15, 15-26:17-28, 27+31:29, 28-30:7-9. The seventh fascicle of the Chinese version is a ritualisation of the entire text, apparently composed later than the preceding chapters and circulated as a separate work in India. This short ritual text, the Maha^vairocana-abhisam!bodhisambaddhapu^ja^vidhi, was also translated by Vajrabodhi 金刚智 as the Abridged Recitation Su^tra 要略念诵经 (T.849). For a preliminary English translation of the whole text, see Chikyo Yamamoto, Maha^vairocanasu^tra, Satapit!aka series 359, 1990.The Dapiluzhena chengfo shenbian jiachi jing lianhua taizang puti chuangbiaozhi putong zhenyanzang guangda chengjiu yuqie (text indlevel="1" loc=""lang="eng">Yoga of Enormous Success: the Lotus-Matrix Bodhi, Symbols, Banners, and Store of Common Mantras in the Vairocana-abhisam!bodhi-tantra). 3 fasc.

The fascicle numbers of the original and the commentary correspond as follows: 1:1-8, 2:9-10, 3:19:13, 4:12-13, 5:14-17, 6:18-20. Partially based on lectures given by S/ubha^karasi?ha 善无畏 at the time of its translation. A great many Sanskrit terms and their Chinese equivalents are described in detail, and Yixing supports doctrinal points with citations from a plethora of Chinese Maha^ya^na texts -- occasionally adding insights from his experience with the Tattvasam!graha system (T 866). These informed references to existing traditions, together with the natural authority of S/ubha^karasi?ha's comments, contributed greatly to the successful adoption of the Vairocana-abhisam!bodhi-tantra in East Asia.  (An abridged version, the Dainichikyo^ gishaku 大日经义释 (Z.36.507ff), was circulated by Yixing's associates after his death.) Ku^kai 空海 frequently quotes Yixing's full commentary in his writings; he was the first to bring it to Japan, where sub-commentaries were written by Saisen 济暹 (T 2215), Raiyu 赖瑜 (T 2217), Yu^han 宥范 (T 2213), Sho^ken 圣宪 (T 2539), Yu^kai 宥快 (T 2218) and Donjaku 昙寂 (T 2219); of these, the latter two are perhaps the most helpful.

It was initiated by Hui Man in the dynasty of Bei-Chai, and was promoted by Chi-Hai in Tsui Dynasty. Mainly based on Lotus Sutra, Tien Tai Sect explains all universal phenomena with Three Dogmas. For the practices, it emphasizes cutting off Three Delusions, thus establishes the method of Three Meditations of One Mind.
Tiantai zong; one of the thirteen schools of Buddhism in China 十三宗, and Japan. Also called the "Lotus Sutra School" 法华宗.  (1) China: A Maha^ya^na school established by Zhiyi 智□ of Tiantai mountain. Zhiyi, taking the Lotus Sutra 法华经 as his basis, classified the other Buddhist sutras into five periods 五时 and eight types of teachings; he discussed the theory of perfect interpenetration of the triple truth 三谛 and taught the rapid attainment of Buddhahood through the practice of observing the mind. The Chinese line of transmission starts with Huiwen 慧文 of the Northern Chi and follows with Huisi 慧思. Next Zhiyi explained the three great scriptures of the school 法华三部 emphasizing both scriptural study and practice. The sixth patriarch, Jingqi 荆溪 also popularized the sect through his commentaries on these three scriptures.  (2) Korea: Tiantai was introduced to Korea as Ch'ont'ae a couple of times during earlier periods, but was not firmly established until the time of Uich'on 义天 (1055-1101) who established Ch'ont'ae in the Koryo as an independent sect. Due to Uich'on's influence, it came to be a major force in the world of Koryo Buddhism. After he returned from Song China in 1086, Uich'on sought to ease conflict between the doctrinal 教 schools and Son 禅 schools, believing that the Ch'ont'ae doctrine would be effective to this end. Ch'ont'ae would eventually die out in Korea, its teachings being absorbed into the Chogye Son 曹溪tradition.  (3) Japan: The Tiantai teaching was brought to Japan by Jianshen 鉴真 in the middle of the 8th century, but it was not widely accepted. In 805, Saicho^ 最澄 brought back the Tendai teachings from China and made the temple that he had built on Mt. Hiei 比睿山, the Enryakuji, a center for the study and practice of Tendai. However, what he had transmitted from China was not exclusively Tendai, but also included Zen 禅, Esoteric 密教 and Monastic Discipline 戒律 teachings. This tendency became more marked in the doctrines of his successors, such as Ennin 圆仁 and Enchin 圆珍. The Tendai sect flourished under the patronage of the imperial family and nobility in Japan.Literally, "celestial palace." The heavenly realm 天上界, where one may be reborn as a result of good actions.

Thus it is, relatively speaking, a fortuitous rebirth. But it is nonetheless a karma-based rebirth, and falls far short of the existence of arhats, pratyekabuddhas and bodhisattvas. Some explanations also point out that while rebirth in a heavenly state is the result of a predominance of good karma, there is still a degree of causation by subtle evil.
