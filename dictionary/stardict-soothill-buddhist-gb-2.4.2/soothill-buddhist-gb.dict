Triratna, or Ratnatraya, i.e. the Three Precious Ones: 佛 Buddha, 法 Dharma, 侩 Sagha, i.e. Buddha, the Law, the Ecelesia or Order. Eitel suggests this trinity may be adapted from the Trimrti, i.e, Brahma, Viu, and Sva. The Triratna takes many forms, e.g. the Trikya 三身 q.v. There is also the Nepalese idea of a triple existence of each Buddha as a Nirva-Buddha, Dhyni-Buddha, and Mnui-Buddha; also the Tantric trinity of Vairocana as Nirva-Buddha, Locana according to Eitel "existing in reflex in the world of forms", and the human Buddha, kyamuni. There are other elaborated details known as the four and the six kinds of triratna 四 and 六种三, e.g. that the Triratna exists in each member of the trinity. The term has also been applied to the 三仙 q.v. Popularly the 三 are referred to the three images in the main hall of monasteries. The centre one is kyamuni, on his left Bhaiajya 药师 and on his right Amitbha. There are other explanations, e.g. in some temples Amitbha is in the centre, Avalokitevara on his left, and Mahsthmaprpta or Majur on his right. Table of Triratna, Trikya, and Trailokya: --

See Vibh stra 婆沙论 77 or 俱舍论 20.The Sarvstivadah school maintains that as the three states (past, present, future) are real, so the substance of all things is permanent; i.e. time is real, matter is eternal.Mind, or thought, past, present or future, is momentary, always moving, unreal and cannot be laid hold of.The mind or thought, past, present, future, cannot be held fast; the past is gone, the future not arrived, the present does not stay.idem 三生.The wisdom-law or moral law that frees from all impediments, past, present, and future.

The three are styled 小,中, and 大. Sometimes the three vehicles are defined as 声闻 rvaka, that of the hearer or obedient disciple; 缘觉Pratyeka-buddha, that of the enlightened for self; these are described as 小乘 because the objective of both is personal salvation; the third is 菩萨Bodhisattva, or 大乘 Mahyna, because the objective is the salvation of all the living. The three are also depicted as 三车 three wains, drawn by a goat, a deer, an ox. The Lotus declares that the three are really the One Buddha-vehicle, which has been revealed in three expedient forms suited to his disciples' capacity, the Lotus Stra being the unifying, complete, and final exposition. The Three Vehicles are differently explained by different exponents, e.g. (1) Mahyna recognizes (a) rvaka, called Hnayna, leading in longer or shorter periods to arhatship; (b) Pratyeka-buddha, called Madhyamayna, leading after still longer or shorter periods to a Buddhahood ascetically attained and for self; (c) Bodhisattva, called Mahayana, leading after countless ages of self-sacrifce in saving others and progressive enlightenment to ultimate Buddhahood. (2) Hnayna is also described as possessing three vehicles 声, 缘, 菩 or 小, 中, 大, the 小 and 中 conveying to personal salvation their devotees in ascetic dust and ashes and mental annihilation, the 大 leading to bodhi, or perfect enlightenment, and the Buddha's way. Further definitions of the Triyna are: (3) True bodhisattva teaching for the 大; pratyeka-buddha without ignorant asceticism for the 中; and rvaka with ignorant asceticism for the 小. (4) (a) 一乘 The One-Vehicle which carries all to Buddhahood: of this the 华严 Hua-yen and 法华 Fa-hua are typical exponents; (b) 三乘法 the three-vehicle, containing practitioners of all three systems, as expounded in books of the 深密般若; (c) 小乘 the Hnayna pure and simple as seen in the 四阿合经 Four gamas. rvakas are also described as hearers of the Four Truths and limited to that degree of development; they hear from the pratyeka-buddhas, who are enlightened in the Twelve Nidnas 因缘; the bodhisattvas make the 六度 or six forms of transmigration their field of sacrificial saving work, and of enlightenment. The Lotus Stra really treats the 三乘. Three Vehicles as 方便 or expedient ways, and offers a 佛乘 Buddha Vehicle as the inclusive and final vehicle.The 三乘家 consider the Triyna as real, and the "one vehicle" of the Lotus School as merely tactical, or an expedient form of expression.The Dharmalakaa School of the Three Vehicles, led by the 法相宗.v. 三退屈.(or 三事衣) A term for a monk's robe of five, seven, or nine patches.A woman's three subordinations, to father, husband, and son; stated in several stras, e.g. 四十华严经28.The three is or wise men and the two devas, i.e. 迦毗罗 Kapila, founder of the Skhya philosophy; 鸺□ or 优楼□ Ulka or Kada, founder of the 胜论宗 or Vaieika philosophy; and 勒沙婆 abha, founder of the Nirgranthas; with iva and Viu as the two deities.Savaji; the heretical people of Vji, an ancient kingdom north of the Ganges, south-east of Nepal.

All creatures in body, voice, and mind are only individualized parts of the Tathgata, but illusion hides their Tathgata nature from them. The esoterics seek to realize their Tathgata nature by physical signs and postures, by voicing of 言 dhra and by meditations, so that 入我我入 He may enter me and I Him, which is the perfection of siddhi 悉地; v. 大日经疏 1. 菩提心论.The three mystic things associated with the six elements, i.e. the mystic body is associated with earth, water, and fire; the mystic words with wind and space; the mystic mind with 识 cognition.v. 三弥底 sammityanikya.The three mystic things, body, mouth, and mind, of the Tathgata are identical with those of all the living, so that even the fleshly body born of parents is the dharmakya, or body of Buddha: 父母所生之肉身佛身也.The three honoured ones: Buddha, the Law, the Ecclesia or Order.

Another group is Bhaiajya, Vairocana, and Candraprabha; and another, kyamun, Majur, and Samantabhadra.The three honoured Buddhas of the West: Amitbha, Avalokitevara, Mahsthmaprpta.

Thus in samdhi the Buddha "body" is found everywhere and in everything (pan-Buddha), every sound becomes a "true word", <foreign lang="sa">dhra</foreign> or potent phrase, and these are summed up in mind, which being universal is my mind and my mind it, 入我我入 it in me and I in it. Other definitions of the three are 佛, 法, 侩 the <foreign lang="sa">triratna</foreign>; and 心, 佛, 生 mind, Buddha, and the living. Also 三三昧.

A Hnayna sect the 正量部 correctly commensurate or logical school, very numerous and widely spread during the early centuries of our era. The 三弥底部论 is in the Tripiaka. It taught "that a soul exists in the highest and truest sense", "that an arhat can fall from arhatship, that a god can enter the paths of the Order, and that even an unconverted man can get rid of all lust and ill-will" (Eliot, i, 260). It split into the three branches of Kaurukullak vantikh, and Vtsputry.

The three formulas are 归依佛 Buddham araa gacchmi, 归依法 Dharma saraa gacchmi, 归依僧 Sagha araa gacchmi. It is "the most primitive formula fidei of the early Buddhists". The surrender is to the Buddha as teacher 师, the Law as medicine 药, the Ecclesia as friends 友. These are known as the 三归依.(三归戒) The ceremony which makes the recipient a 优婆塞 or 优婆夷 upasaka or upsik male or female disciple, accepting the five commandments.

The first of the following three is common to all disciples, the two last to bodhisattvas. They arise from (a) 见, 思, 惑 things seen and thought, i.e. illusions from imperfect perception, with temptation to love, hate, etc.; to be rid of these false views and temptations is the discipline and nirva of ascetic or Hnayna Buddhists. Mahyna proceeds further in and by its bodhisattva aims, which produce their own difficulties, i.e. (b) 尘沙惑 illusion and temptation through the immense variety of duties in saving men; and (c) 无明惑 illusions and temptations that arise from failure philosophically to understand things in their reality.The three evil thoughts are the last, desire, hate, malevolence; the three good thoughts are 怨想 thoughts of (love to) enemies, 亲想 the same to family and friends, 中人想 the same to those who are neither enemies nor friends, i.e. to all; v. 智度论 72.Samudra, the sea, an ocean; also 三母捺罗娑罗 samudra-sgara.

In Japan they are Shinto, Confucianism, and Buddhism. In Buddhism the term is applied to the three periods of kyamuni's own teaching, of which there are several definitions: (1) The Jiangnan 南中 School describe his teaching as (a) 渐progressive or gradual; (b) 顿 immediate, i.e. as one whole, especially in the 华严经; and (c) 不定 or indeterminate. (2) 光统 Guangtong, a writer of the Iater Wei dynasty, describes the three as (a) 渐 progressive for beginners, i.e. from impermanence to permanence, from the void to reality, etc.; (b) 顿 immediate for the more advanced; and (c) 圆complete, to the most advanced, i.e. the Huayan as above.

They are: (1) 有, when he taught the 实有 reality of the skandhas and elements, but denied the common belief in 实我 real personality or a permanent soul; this period is represented by the four 阿含经 gamas and other Hnayna stras. (2) 空 nya, when he negatived the idea of 实法 the reality of things and advocated that all was 空 unreal; the period of the 般若经 praj stras. (3) 中 Madhyama, the mean, that mind or spirit is real, while things are unreal; the period of this school's specific stra the 解深密经, also the 法华 and later stras. In the two earlier periods he is said to have 方便 adapted his teaching to the development of his hearers; in the third to have delivered his complete and perfect doctrine. Another division by the 空宗 is (1) as above; (2) the early period of the Mahyna represented, by the 深密经; (3) the higher Mahyna as in the 般若经. v. also 三.The three insights; also 三达.

The three clear conceptions that (1) all is impermanent 无常 anitya; (2) all is sorrowful 苦 dukha; (3) all is devoid of a self 无我 antman.(三昧地) Samdhi, "putting together, composing the mind, intent contemplation, perfect absorption, union of the meditator with the object of meditation." (M. W.) Also 三摩地 (三摩提, 三摩帝, 三摩底). Interpreted by 定 or 正定, the mind fixed and undisturbed; by 正受 correct sensation of the object contemplated; by 调直定 ordering and fixing the mind; by 正心行处 the condition when the motions of the mind are steadied and harmonized with the object; by 息虑凝心 the cessation of distraction and the fixation of the mind; by 等持 the mind held in equilibrium; by 奢摩他, i.e. 止息 to stay the breathing. It is described as concentration of the mind (upon an object). The aim is 解脱, mukti, deliverance from all the trammels of life, the bondage of the passions and reincarnations. It may pass from abstraction to ecstasy, or rapture, or trance. Dhyna 定 represents a simpler form of contemplation; sampatti 三摩底 a stage further advanced; and samdhi the highest stage of the Buddhist equivalent for Yoga, though Yoga is considered by some as a Buddhist development differing from samdhi. The 翻译名义 says: 思专 when the mind has been concentrated, then 志一不分 the will is undivided; when 想寂 active thought has been put to rest, then 气虚神 the material becomes etherealized and the spirit liberated, on which 智 knowledge, or the power to know, has free course, and there is no mystery into which it cannot probe.

It flourished up to the latter part of the Tang dynasty. In 625 it was carried to Japan as Sanron. After the death of Jiaxiang, who wrote the 三论玄义, a northern and southern division took place. While the Mdhyamika denied the reality of all phenomenal existence, and defined the noumenal world in negative terms, its aim seems not to have been nihilistic, but the advocacy of a reality beyond human conception and expression, which in our terminology may be termed a spiritual realm.The three states of mind or consciousness: 识 the original unsullied consciousness or Mind, the <foreign lang="sa">tathgatagarbha</foreign>, the eighth or <foreign lang="sa">laya</foreign> 阿赖耶识 ; 现识 mind or consciousness diversified in contact with or producing phenomena, good and evil; 分别识 consciousness discriminating and evolving the objects of the five senses.

The "middle" school of
Tiantai says 空, 假. 中 i.e. 就是空, 假, 中; (a) by 空<foreign lang="sa">nya</foreign> is meant that things causally produced are in
their essential nature unreal (or immaterial) 实空无; (b) 假, though things
are unreal in their essential nature their derived forms are real; (c) 中;
but both are one, being of the one 如 reality. These three dogmas are
founded on a verse of Ngrjuna's-- 因缘所生法, 我说是空 亦
是假名, 亦是中道义 "All causally produced phenomena, I say, are
unreal, Are but a passing name, and indicate the 'mean'." There are other
explanations-- the 圆教 interprets the 空 and 假 as 中; the 别教 makes 中 
independent. 空 is the all, i.e. the totality of all things, and is spoken
of as the  or 实 true, or real; 假 is the differentiation of all things
and is spoken of as 俗 common, i.e. things as commonly named; 中 is the
connecting idea which makes a unity of both, e.g. "all are but parts of one
stupendous whole." The 中 makes all and the all into one whole, unifying the
whole and its parts. 空 may be taken as the immaterial, the undifferentiated
all, the sum of existences, by some as the tathgatagarbha 如来藏; 假as the
unreal, or impermanent, the material or transient form, the temporal that
can be named, the relative or discrete; 中 as the unifier, which places each
in the other and all in all. The "shallower" 山外 school associated 空 and 
中 with the noumenal universe as opposed to the phenomenal and illusory
existence represented by 假. The "profounder" 山 school teaches that all
three are aspects of the same.The unity of 空, 假, 中, three aspects of the same reality, taught by the 圆教as distinguished from the 别教which separates them.(or三贤十地). The three virtuous positions, or states, of a bodhisattva are 十住, 十行 and 十向.

To turn out well, prosper, be on the path of success.trikya. 三宝身 The threefold body or nature of a Buddha, i.e. the 法, 报, and 化身, or <foreign lang="sa">dharmakya</foreign>, <foreign lang="sa">sambhogakya</foreign>, and <foreign lang="sa">nirmakya</foreign>. The three are defined as 自性, 受用, and 变化, the Buddha-body per se, or in its essential nature; his body of bliss, which he "receives" for his own "use" and enjoyment; and his body of transformation, by which he can appear in any form; i.e. spiritual, or essential; glorified; revealed. While the doctrine of the <foreign lang="sa">trikya</foreign> is a Mahyna concept, it partly results from the Hnayna idealization of the earthly Buddha with his thirty-two signs, eighty physical marks, clairvoyance, clairaudience, holiness, purity, wisdom, pity, etc. Mahyna, however, proceeded to conceive of Buddha as the Universal, the All, with infinity of forms, yet above all our concepts of unity or diversity. To every Buddha Mahyna attributed a three-fold body: that of essential Buddha; that of joy or enjoyment of the fruits of his past saving labours; that of power to transform himself at will to any shape for omnipresent salvation of those who need him. The trinity finds different methods of expression, e.g. Vairocana is entitled 法身, the embodiment of the Law, shining everywhere, enlightening all; Locana is 报身; c.f. 三宾, the embodiment of purity and bliss; kyamuni is 化身 or Buddha revealed. In the esoteric sect they are 法 Vairocana, 报 Amitbha, and 化 kyamuni. The 三宾 are also 法 dharma, 报 sagha, 化 buddha. Nevertheless, the three are considered as a trinity, the three being essentially one, each in the other. (1) 法身 Dharmakya in its earliest conception was that of the body of the dharma, or truth, as preached by kyamuni; later it became his mind or soul in contrast with his material body. In Mdhyamika, the <foreign lang="sa">dharmakya</foreign> was the only reality, i.e. the void, or the immateria1, the ground of all phenomena; in other words, the 如 the <foreign lang="sa">tathgatagarbha</foreign>, the <foreign lang="sa">bhtatathat</foreign>. According to the Huayan (Kegon) School it is the 理or noumenon, while the other two are气or phenomenal aspects. "For the Vijnavda... the body of the law as highest reality is the void intelligence, whose infection (<foreign lang="sa">saklea</foreign>) results in the process of birth and death, whilst its purification brings about Nirva, or its restoration to its primitive transparence" (Keith). The "body of the law is the true reality of everything". Nevertheless, in Mahyna every Buddha has his own 法身; e.g. in the <foreign lang="sa">dharmakya</foreign> aspect we have the designation Amitbha, who in his <foreign lang="sa">sabhogakya</foreign> aspect is styled Amityus. (2) 报身Sambhogakya, a Buddha's reward body, or body of enjoyment of the merits he attained as a bodhisattva; in other words, a Buddha in glory in his heaven. This is the form of Buddha as an object of worship. It is defined in two aspects, (a) 自受用身 for his own bliss, and (b) 他受用身 for the sake of others, revealing himself in his glory to bodhisattvas, enlightening and inspiring them. By wisdom a Buddha's <foreign lang="sa">dharmakya</foreign> is attained, by bodhisattva-merits his <foreign lang="sa">sabhogakya</foreign>. Not only has every Buddha all the three bodies or aspects, but as all men are of the same essence, or nature, as Buddhas, they are therefore potential Buddhas and are in and of the <foreign lang="sa">trikya</foreign>.

The five are now differentiated into 十宗 ten schools. The other division, by 圭 Guifeng of the same school, is (1) 人天教 rebirth as human beings for those who keep the five commandments and as devas those who keep the 十善 as 相始教  above; (4) 大乘破相教 as 空始教 above; and (5) 一乘显性教 the one vehicle which reveals the universal Buddha-nature; it includes (3), (4), and (5) of the first group.

Of the six elements 六大 earth, water, fire, air (or wind), ether (or space) 昙空, and consciousness (or mind 识 ), the first five form the phenomenal world, or Garbhadhtu, the womb of all things 胎藏界, the sixth is the conscious, or perceptive, or wisdom world, the Vajradhtu 金刚界, sometimes called the Diamond realm. The two realms are not originally apart, but one, and there is no consciousness without the other five elements. The sixth element, vijna, is further subdivided into five called the 五智 Five Wisdoms: (1) 法界体性智 <foreign lang="sa">dharmadhtu-prakti-jna</foreign>, derived from the <foreign lang="sa">amala-vijna</foreign>, or pure 识; it is the wisdom of the embodied nature of the <foreign lang="sa">dharmadhtu</foreign>, defined as the six elements, and is associated with Vairocana 大日, in the centre, who abides in this <foreign lang="sa">samdhi</foreign>; it also corresponds to the ether 空 element. (2) 大圆镜智 <foreign lang="sa">adarana-jna</foreign>, the great round mirror wisdom, derived from the <foreign lang="sa">laya</foreign>-<foreign lang="sa">vijna</foreign>, reflecting all things; corresponds to earth, and is associated with Akobhya and the east. (3) 平等性智 <foreign lang="sa">samat-jna</foreign>, derived from <foreign lang="sa">mano-vijna</foreign>, wisdom in regard to all things equally and universally; corresponds to fire, and is associated with Ratnasabhava and the south. (4) 妙观察智 <foreign lang="sa">pratyavekaa-jna</foreign>, derived from 意识, wisdom of profound insight, or discrimination, for exposition and doubt-destruction; corresponds to water, and is associated with Amitbha and the west. (5) 成所作智 <foreign lang="sa">ktynuhna-jna</foreign>, derived from the five senses, the wisdom of perfecting the double work of self-welfare and the welfare of others; corresponds to air 风 and is associated with Amoghasiddhi and the north. These five Dhyni-Buddhas are the 五智如来. The five kinds of wisdom are the four belonging to every Buddha, of the exoteric cult, to which the esoteric cult adds the first, pure, all-refecting, universal, all-discerning, and all-perfecting.五智五佛; 五佛; 五如来 The five
Dhyni-Buddhas, or Wisdom-Tathgatas of the Vajradhtu 金刚界, idealizations
of five aspects of wisdom; possibly of Nepalese origin. The Wisdom Buddha
represents the <foreign lang="sa">dharmakya</foreign> or Buddha-mind, also
the Dharma of the triratna, or trinity. Each evolves one of the five
colours, one of the five senses, a Dhyani-bodhisattva in two forms one
gracious, the other fierce, and a Mnui-Buddha; each has his own akti,
i. e. feminine energy or complement; also his own bja, or germ-sound 种子 
or 印 seal, i. e. 言 real or substantive word, the five being for 大日 a,
for 阿 h, for 宝生 ? hr, for 弥陀 ? a, for 不 空 ? . The five are
also described as the emanations or forms of an di-Buddha, Vajrasattva; the
four are considered by others to be emanations or forms of Vairocana as the
Supreme Buddha. The five are not always described as the same, e. g. they
may be 药师 (or 王) Bhaiajya, 多宝 Prabhtaratna, Vairocana, Akobhya, and
either Amoghasiddhi or kyamuni. Below is a classified list of the
generally accepted five with certain particulars connected with them, but
these differ in different places, and the list can only be a general
guide. As to the Dhyni-bodhisattvas, each Buddha evolves three forms 五佛生
五菩萨, 五金刚, 五忿怒, i. e. (1) a bodhisattva who represents the Buddha's
<foreign lang="sa">dharmakya</foreign>, or spiritual body; (2) a vajra or
diamond form who represents his wisdom in graciousness; and (3) a fierce or
angry form, the 明王 who represents his power against evil. (1) Vairocana
appears in the three forms of 转法轮菩萨 Vajra-pramit Bodhisattva, 遍照金
刚 Universally Shining Vajrasattva, and 不动明王 rya-Acalantha Rja; (2)
Akobhya's three forms are 虚空藏 kagarbha, 如意 complete power, and 军荼
利明王 Kual-rja; (3 ) Ratnasabhava's are 普贤 Samantabhadra, 萨□ 
Sattvavajra, and 孙婆 or 降三世明王 Trailokyavijayarja; (4) Amitbha's are 
观世音 Avalokitevara, 法金刚 Dharmarja, and 马头明王 Hayagrva, the
horse-head Dharmapla; (5) Amoghasiddhi's are 弥勒 Maitreya, 业金刚 
Karmavajra, and 金刚夜叉 Vajrayaka. The above Bodhisattvas differ from
those in the following list: -- <lb></lb>Table

Buddha means "completely conscious, enlightened", and came to mean the enlightener. he Chinese translation is 觉 to perceive, aware, awake; and 智 gnosis, knowledge. There is an Eternal Buddha, see e.g. the <title>Lotus Sutra</title>, cap. 16, and multitudes of Buddhas, but the personality of a Supreme Buddha, an di-Buddha, is not defined. Buddha is in and through all things, and some schools are definitely Pan-Buddhist in the pantheistic sense. In the <foreign lang="sa">triratna</foreign> 三 commonly known as 三佛, while kyamuni Buddha is the first "person" of the Trinity, his Law the second, and the Order the third, all three by some are accounted as manifestations of the All-Buddha. As kyamuni, the title indicates him as the last of the line of Buddhas who have appeared in this world, Maitreya is to be the next. As such he is the one who has achieved enlightenment, having discovered the essential evil of existence (some say mundane existence, others all existence), and the way of deliverance from the constant round of reincarnations; this way is through the moral life into nirvana, by means of self-abnegation, the monastic life, and meditation. By this method a Buddha, or enlightened one, himself obtains Supreme Enlightenment, or Omniscience, and according to Mhyanism leads all beings into the same enlightenment. He sees things not as they seem in their phenomenal but in their noumenal aspects, as they really are. The term is also applied to those who understand the chain of causality (twelve <foreign lang="sa">nidna</foreign>s) and have attained enlightenment surpassing that of the <foreign lang="sa">arhat</foreign>. Four types of the Buddha are referred to: (1) 三藏佛the Buddha of the Tripiaka who attained enlightenment on the bare ground under the bodhi-tree; (2) 通佛the Buddha on the <foreign lang="sa">deva</foreign> robe under the bodhi-tree of the seven precious things; (3) 别佛the Buddha on the great precious Lotus throne under the Lotus realm bodhi-tree; and (4) 圆佛the Buddha on the throne of Space in the realm of eternal rest and glory where he is Vairocana. The Hnayna only admits the existence of one Buddha at a time; Mahyna claims the existence of many Buddhas at one and the same time, as many Buddhas as there are Buddha-universes, which are infinite in number.
buddhaketra. 佛纥差怛罗 Buddha realm, land or country; see also 佛土, 佛国. The term is absent from Hnayna. In Mahyna it is the spiritual realm acquired by one who reaches perfect enlightenment, where he instructs all beings born there, preparing them for enlightenment. In the schools where Mahyna adopted an di-Buddha, these realms or Buddha-fields interpenetrated each other, since they were coexistent with the universe. There are two classes of Buddhaketra: (1) in the Vairocana Schools, regarded as the regions of progress for the righteous after death; (2) in the Amitbha Schools, regarded as the Pure Land; v. McGovern, <title>A Manual of Buddhist Philosophy</title>, pp. 70-2.

consists of eighty small <foreign lang="sa">kalpa</foreign>s. Each small
<foreign lang="sa">kalpa</foreign> is divided into a period of  increase
and 减 decrease; the increase period is ruled over by the four <foreign lang="sa">cakravart</foreign>s in succession, i.e. the four ages of iron,
copper, silver, gold, during which the length of human life increases by one
year every century to 84,000 years, and the length of the human body to
8,400 feet. Then comes the <foreign lang="sa">kalpa</foreign> of decrease
divided into periods of the three woes, pestilence, war, famine, during
which the length of human life is gradually reduced to ten years and the
human body to 1 foot in height. There are other distinctions of the <foreign lang="sa">kalpa</foreign>s. A small <foreign lang="sa">kalpa</foreign> is
represented as 16,800,000 years, a <foreign lang="sa">kalpa</foreign> as
336,000,000 years, and a <foreign lang="sa">mahkalpa</foreign> as
1,334,000,000 years. There are many ways of illustrating the length of a
<foreign lang="sa">kalpa</foreign>, e.g. pass a soft cloth over a solid rock
40 <foreign lang="zh">li</foreign> in size once in a hundred years, when
finally the rock has been thus worn away a <foreign lang="sa">kalpa</foreign> will not yet have passed; or a city of 40 <foreign lang="zh">li</foreign>, filled with mustard seeds, one being removed every

The four dogmas, or noble truths, the primary and fundamental doctrines of kyamuni, said to approximate to the form of medical diagnosis. They are pain or 'suffering, its cause, its ending, the way thereto; that existence is suffering, that human passion (<foreign lang="sa">tah</foreign>, 欲 desire) is the cause of continued suffering, that by the destruction of human passion existence may be brought to an end; that by a life of holiness the destruction of human passion may be attained'. Childers. The four are 苦, 聚 (or 集), 灭, and 道谛, i. e. <foreign lang="sa">dukha</foreign> 豆□, <foreign lang="sa">samudaya</foreign> 三牟提耶, <foreign lang="sa">nirodha</foreign> 尼栖陀, and <foreign lang="sa">mrga</foreign> 末加. Eitel interprets them (1) 'that 'misery' is a necessary attribute of sentient existence'; (2) that 'the 'accumulation' of misery is caused by the passions'; (3) that 'the 'extinction' of passion is possible; (4) <foreign lang="sa">mrga</foreign> is 'the doctrine of the 'path' that leads to the extinction of passion'. (1) 苦 suffering is the lot of the 六趣 six states of existence; (2) 集 is the aggregation (or exacerbation) of suffering by reason of the passions; (3) 灭 is nirvana, the extinction of desire and its consequences, and the leaving of the sufferings of mortality as void and extinct; (4) 道 is the way of such extinction, i. e. the 八正道 eightfold correct way. The first two are considered to be related to this life, the last two to 出世间 a life outside or apart from the world. The four are described as the fundamental doctrines first preached to his five former ascetic companions. Those who accepted these truths were in the stage of <foreign lang="sa">rvaka</foreign>. There is much dispute as to the meaning of 灭 'extinction' as to whether it means extinction of suffering, of passion, or of existence. The <title>Nirvana Sutra</title> 18 says that whoever accepts the four dogmas will put an end to births and deaths 若能见四谛则得断生死 which does not of necessity mean the termination of existence but that of continued transmigration. v. 灭.The sutra of the four dogmas, tr. by 安世高 An Shih Kao, one <foreign lang="zh">juan</foreign>. 四趣 Durgati; the four evil directions or destinations: the hells, hungry ghosts, animals, <foreign lang="sa">asura</foreign>s; v. 四恶.The four <foreign lang="sa">kya</foreign>, or 'bodies'.

The term has had three references. The first was by 光统 Guangtong of the Later Wei, sixth century, who defined three schools, 渐 gradual, 顿 immediate, and 圆 inclusive or complete. The Tiantai called its fourth section the inclusive, complete, or perfect teaching 圆, the other three being 三藏 Hnayna, 通 Mahyna-cum-Hnayna, 别 Mahyna. The Huayan so called its fifth section, i.e. 小乘; 大乘始; 大乘终; 顿 and 圆. It is the Tiantai version that is in general acceptance, defined as a perfect whole and as complete in its parts; for the whole is the absolute and its parts are therefore the absolute; the two may be called noumenon and phenomenon, or 空 and 假 (or 俗), but in reality they are one, i.e. the 中 medial condition. To conceive these three as a whole is the Tiantai inclusive or 'perfect' doctrine. The Huayan 'perfect' doctrine also taught that unity and differentiation, or absolute and relative, were one, a similar doctrine to that of the identity of contraries. In Tiantai teaching the harmony is due to its underlying unity; its completeness to the permeation of this unity in all phenomena; these two are united in the medial 中 principle; to comprehend these three principles at one and the same time is the complete, all-containing, or 'perfect' doctrine of Tiantai. There are other definitions of the all-inclusive doctrine, e.g. the eight complete things, complete in teaching, principles, knowledge, etc. 圆教四门 v. 四门.The Tiantai doctrine of the complete cutting off, at one remove, of the three illusions, i.e. 见思 associated with 空; 尘沙 with 假; and 无明 with 中; q. v.The potentiality of becoming fully enlightened at once.Inclusive to the uttermost; absolute perfection.Perfect fruit, <foreign lang="sa">nirva</foreign>.The all-embracing ocean, i.e. the perfection or power of the Tathgata.Completely full; wholly complete; the fulfilling of the whole, i.e. that the part contains the whole, the absolute in the relative.The complete, or all-inclusive <foreign lang="sa">stra</foreign>, a term applied to the <title>Huayan jing</title>.Complete vacuity, i.e. 空空, from which even the idea of vacuity is absent.Complete combination; the absolute in the relative and vice versa; the identity of apparent contraries; perfect harmony among all differences, as in water and waves, passion and enlightenment, transmigration and <foreign lang="sa">nirva</foreign>, or life and death, etc.; all are of the same fundamental nature, all are <foreign lang="sa">bhtatathat</foreign>, and <foreign lang="sa">bhtatathat</foreign> is all; waves are one with waves, and water is one with water, and water and wave are one.The three dogmas of 空假中 as combined, as one and the same, as a unity, according to the Tiantai inclusive or perfect school.

Earth-prison is generally intp. as hell or the hells; it may also be termed purgatory; one of the six <foreign lang="sa">gati</foreign> or ways of transmigration. The hells are divided into three classes: I. Central, or radical, 根本地狱 consisting of (1) The eight hot hells. These were the original hells of primitive Buddhism, and are supposed to be located umder the southern continent Jambudvpa 瞻部州, 500 <foreign lang="sa">yojana</foreign>s below the surface. (a) 等活 or 更活 Sajva, rebirth, where after many kinds of suffering a cold wind blows over the soul and returns it to this life as it was before, hence the name 等活.

(h) 摩诃特摩 Mahpadma, ditto like great red lotus buds. Somewhat different names are also given. Cf. 舍论 8; 智度论 16; 涅盘经 11. II. The secondary hells are called 近边地狱 adjacent hells or 十六游增 each of its four sides, opening from each such door are four adjacent hells, in all sixteen; thus with the original eight there are 136. A list of eighteen hells is given in the 十八泥梨经. III. A third class is called the 孤地狱 (独地狱)  Lokntarika, or isolated hells in mountains, deserts, below the earth and above it. Eitel says in regard to the eight hot hells that they range 'one beneath the other in tiers which begin at a depth of 11,900 <foreign lang="sa">yojana</foreign>s and reach to a depth of 40,000 <foreign lang="sa">yojana</foreign>s'. The cold hells are under 'the two Tchahavlas and range shaft-like one below the other, but so that this shaft is gradually widening to the fourth hell and then narrowing itself again so that the first and last hell have the shortest, those in the centre the longest diameter'. 'Every universe has the same number of hells, ' but 'the northern continent has no hell whatever, the two continents east and west of Meru have only small Lokntarika hells... whilst all the other hells are required for the inhabitants of the southern continent '. It may be noted that the purpose of these hells is definitely punitive, as well as purgatorial. Yama is the judge and ruler, assisted by eighteen officers and a host of demons, who order or administer the various degrees of torture. 'His sister performs the same duties with regard to female criminals, ' and it may be mentioned that the Chinese have added the 血盆池 Lake of the bloody bath, or 'placenta tank' for women who die in childbirth.

With hints of a feminine origin, he is now the guardian of the earth. Though associated with Yama as overlord, and with the dead and the hells, his role is that of saviour. Depicted with the alarum staff with its six rings, he is accredited with power over the hells and is devoted to the saving of all creatures between the nirvana of kyamuni and the advent of Maitreya the fifth century he has been especially considered as the deliverer from the hells. His central place in China is at Chiu-hua-shan, forty li south-west of Ch'ing-yang in Anhui. In Japan he is also the protector of travellers by land and his image accordingly appears on the roads; bereaved parents put stones by his images to seek his aid in relieving the labours of their dead in the task of piling stones on the banks of the Buddhist Styx; he also helps women in labour. He is described as holding a place between the gods and men on the one hand and the hells on the other for saving all in distress; some say he is an incarnation of Yama. At dawn he sits immobile on the earth 地 and meditates on the myriads of its beings 藏. When represented as a monk, it may be through the influence of a Korean monk who is considered to be his incarnation, and who came to China in 653 and died in 728 at the age of 99 after residing at Chiu-hua-shan for seventy-five years: his body, not decaying, is said to have been gilded over and became an object of worship. Many have confused 罗 part of Korea with 暹罗 Siam. There are other developments of Ti-tsang, such as the 六地藏 Six Ti-tsang, i. e. severally converting or transforming those in the hells, <foreign lang="sa">preta</foreign>s, animals, <foreign lang="sa">asura</foreign>s, men, and the <foreign lang="sa">deva</foreign>s; these six Ti-tsang have different images and symbols. Ti-tsang has also six messengers 六使者: Yama for transforming those in hell; the pearl-holder for <foreign lang="sa">preta</foreign>s; the strong one or animals; the <foreign lang="sa">dev</foreign>of mercy for <foreign lang="sa">asura</foreign>s; the <foreign lang="sa">dev</foreign> of the treasure for human beings; one who has charge of the heavens for the <foreign lang="sa">deva</foreign>s. There is also the 延命地藏 Yanming Ti-tsang, who controls length of days and who is approached, as also may be P'u-hsien, for that Purpose; his two assistants are the Supervisors of good and evil 掌善 and 掌恶. Under another form, as 胜军地藏 Ti-tsang is chiefly associated with the esoteric cult. The benefits derived from his worship are many, some say ten, others say twenty-eight. His vows are contained in the 地藏菩萨本愿经. There is also the  大乘大集地藏十电经 tr. by Xuanzang in 10 <foreign lang="zh">juan</foreign> in the seventh century, which probably influenced the spread of the Ti-tsang cult.idem 十地经论.The earth-wheel, one of the 五轮 five circles, i. e. space, wind, water, earth, and above them fire: the five 'wheels' or umbrellas shown on the top of certain <foreign lang="sa">stpa</foreign>s or pagodas.The earth altar is four-cornered and used by the esoteric sect.?Drgha-bhavana-saghrma.

There are works under this title.Mahyna; also called 上乘; 妙乘; 胜乘;   无上乘; 无上上乘; 不恶乘; 无等乘, 无等等乘; 摩诃衍 The great yna, wain, or conveyance, or the greater vehicle in comparison with the 小乘 Hnayna. It indicates universalism, or Salvation for all, for all are Buddha and will attain bodhi. It is the form of Buddhism prevalent in Tibet, Mongolia, China, Korea, Japan, and in other places in the Far East. It is also called Northern Buddhism. It is interpreted as 大教 the greater teaching as compared with 小教 the smaller, or inferior. Hnayna, which is undoubtedly nearer to the original teaching of the Buddha, is unfairly described as an endeavour to seek nirvana through an ash-covered body, an extinguished intellect, and solitariness; its followers are sravakas and pratyekabuddhas (i.e. those who are striving for their  own deliverance through ascetic works).  Mahyna, on the other hand, is described as seeking to find and extend all knowledge, and, in certain schools, to lead all to Buddhahood. It has a conception of an Eternal Buddha, or Buddhahood as Eternal (Adi-Buddha), but its especial doctrines are, inter alia, (a) the bodhisattvas 菩萨 , i.e. beings who deny themselves final Nirvana until, according to their vows, they have first saved all the living; (b) salvation by faith in, or invocation of the Buddhas  or bodhisattvas; (c) Paradise as a nirvana of bliss in the company of Buddhas, bodhisattvas, saints, and believers. Hnayna is sometimes described as 自利 self-benefiting, and Mahyna as 自利利他 self-benefit for the benefit of others, unlimited altruism and pity being the theory of Mahyna. There is a further division into one-yana and three-yanas: the tryna may be rvaka, pratyeka-buddha, and bodhisattva, represented by a goat, deer, or bullock cart; the one-yna is that represented by the Lotus School as the one doctrine of the Buddha, which had been variously taught by him according to the capacity of his hearers, v. 方便. Though Mahyna tendencies are seen in later forms of the older Buddhism, the foundation of Mahyna has been attributed to Ngrjuna 龙树.   "The characteristics of this system are an excess of transcendental speculation tending to abstract nihilism, and the substitution of fanciful degrees of meditation and contemplation (v. Samdhi and Dhyna) in place of the practical asceticism of the Hnayna school."[Eitel 68-9.] Two of its foundation books are the 起信论and the 妙法莲华经 but a larnge numberof Mahyna sutras are ascribed to the Buddha。.The two Mahyna kinds of Buddhahood: (1) that of natural purity, for every one has the inherent nature; (2) that attained by practice.The Mahyna good roots realm, a name for the Amitbha Pure-land of the West.four fruits, or bodhisattva stages in Mahyna, the fourth being that of a Buddha: 须陀洹 srota-panna, 斯陀含 sakdgmin, 。阿理那含 angmin, and 阿罗汉 arhan.

It aims at ecstatic union of the individual soul with the world soul, Ivara. From this result the eight great powers of Siddhi (<foreign lang="sa">aa-mahsiddhi</foreign>), namely, ability to (1) make one's body lighter (laghiman); (2) heavier (gaiman); (3) smaller (aiman); (4) larger (mahiman) than anything in the world ; (5) reach any place (prpti) ; (6) assume any shape (prkmya) ; (7) control all natural laws (itva) ; (8) make everything depend upon oneself; all at will (v.如意身 and 神足). By means of mystic formulas  (Tantras or dhras), or spells (mantras), accompanied by music and manipulation of the hands (mdra), a state of mental fixity characterized neither by thought nor the annihilation of thought, can be reached. This consists of six-fold bodily and mental happiness (yoga), and from this results power to work miracles. Asaga compiled his mystic doctrines circa A.D. 500. The system was introduced into China A.D. 647 by Xuanzang's translation of the <title>Yogcrya-bhmi-stra</title> 瑜伽师地论 ; v. 瑜.

Vaipulya is extension, spaciousness, widespread, and this is the idea expressed both in 广 broad, widespread, as opposed to narrow, restricted, and in 等 levelled up, equal everywhere, universal. These terms suggest the broadening of the basis of Buddhism, as is found in Mahyna. The Vaipulya works are styled sutras, for the broad doctrine of universalism, very different from the traditional account of his discourses, is put into the mouth of the Buddha in wider, or universal aspect. These sutras are those of universalism, of which the Lotus 法华 is an outstanding example. The form Vaitulya instead of Vaipulya is found in some Kashgar MSS. of the Lotus, suggesting that in the Vetulla sect lies the origin of the Vaipulyas, and with them of Mahyna, but the evidence is inadequate.The 本尊 fundamental honoured one of the 华严经, described as the Buddha who has realized the universal law.Buddhvatasaka-mahvaipulya-stra ; the Avatasaka, Hua-yen, or Kegon sutra ; tr. by Buddhabhadra and others A.D. 418-420.

They are called 无量义经 sutras of infinite meaning, or of the infinite; first introduced into China by Dharmaraka (A.D.266317). The name is common to Hnayna and Mahayana, but chiefly claimed by the latter for its special sutras as extending and universalizing the Buddha's earlier preliminary teaching. v. 大方广 and 方等.Mahvaipulya-mahsanipta-stra, tr. A.D. 397439, said to have been preached by the Buddha "from the age of 45 to 49 ...to Buddhas and bodhisattvas assembled from every region, by a great staircase made between the world of desire and that of form".

(Eliot.) There he is known as Dai-nichi-nyorai. He is counted as the first, and according to some, the origin of the five celestial Buddhas (dhyni-buddhas, or jinas). He dwells quiescent in Arpa-dhtu, the Heaven beyond form, and is the essence of wisdom (bodhi) and of absolute purity. Samantabhadra 普贤 is his dhyni-bodhisattva. The 大日经 "teaches that Vairocana is the whole world, which is divided into Garbhadhtu (material) and Vajradhtu (indestructible), the two together forming Dharmadhtu. The manifestations of Vairocana's body to himselfthat is, Buddhas and Bodhisattvas are represented symbolically by diagrams of several circles ". Eliot. In the 金刚界 or <foreign lang="sa">vajradhtu maala</foreign>  he is the center of the five groups. In the 胎藏界 or Garbhadhtu he is the center of the eight-leaf (lotus) court. His appearance, symbols, esoteric word, differ according to the two above distinctions. Generally he is considered as an embodiment of the Truth 法, both in the sense of <foreign lang="sa">dharmakya</foreign> 法身 and <foreign lang="sa">dharmaratna</foreign> 法. Some hold Vairocana to be the <foreign lang="sa">dharmakya</foreign> of kyamuni 大日与释迦同一佛 but the esoteric school denies this identity. Also known as 最高显广眼藏如来, the Tathagata who, in the highest, reveals the far-reaching treasure of his eye, i.e. the sun.  大日大圣不动明王 is described as one of his transformations. Also, a <foreign lang="sa">ramaa</foreign> of Kashmir (contemporary of Padma-sabhava); he is credited with introducing Buddhism into Khotan and being an incarnation of Majur; the king Vijaya Sabhava built a monastery for him.A meeting for the worship of Vairocana.The cult of Vairocana especially associated with the 胎藏界 Garbhakoadhtu, or phenomenal world.

Notwithstanding this, the Saddharma-puarka calls Brahma 'the father of all living beings'" 一切生之父. Mahbrahman is the unborn or uncreated ruler over all, especially according to Buddhism over all the heavens of form, i.e. of mortality. He rules over these heavens, which are of threefold form: (a) Brahma (lord), (b) Brahma-purohitas (ministers), and (c) Brahma-priadyh (people). His heavens are also known as the middle dhyna heavens, i.e. between the first and second dhynas. He is often represented on the right of the Buddha. According to Chinese accounts the Hindus speak of him (1) as born of Nryaa, from Brahma's mouth sprang the brahmans, from his arms the katriyas, from his thighs the vaiyas, and from his feet the dras; (2) as born from Viu; (3) as a trimrti, evidently that of Brahma, Viu, and iva, but Buddhists define Mahbrahma's dharmakya as Mahevara (iva), his sabhogakya as Nryaa, and his nirmakya as Brahm. He is depicted as riding on a swan, or drawn by swans.Mahbrahma deva rja, king of the eighteen Brahmalokas.idem 大梵天 The term is incorrectly said by Chinese interpreters to mean freedom from sexual desire.

It is interpreted in Mahyna as meaning the cessation or extinction of passion and delusion, of mortality, and of all activities, and deliverance into a state beyond these concepts. In Mahyna it is not understood as the annihilation, or cessation of existence; the reappearance of Dpakara 然灯 (who had long entered nirva) along with kyamuni on the Vulture Peak supports this view. It is a state above all terms of human expression.

He is said to be the younger brother of Asaga of the Yogcra school, by whom he was converted from the Sarvstivda school of thought to that of Mahyna and of Ngrjuna. On his conversion he would have 'cut out his tongue' for its past heresy, but was dissuaded by his brother, who bade him use the same tongue to correct his errors, whereupon he wrote the 唯识论 and other Mahayanist works.

Another category is 渐 gradual, 顿 direct, and 圆 perfect, the last being found in the final or complete doctrine of the 法华经 <title>Lotus Sutra</title>.

It bases its tenets on the <title>Lotus Sutra</title> 法华经 with the 智度论, 涅盘经, and 大品经; it maintains the identity of the Absolute and the world of phenomena, and attempts to unlock the secrets of all phenomena by means of meditation. It flourished during the Tang dynasty. Under the Sung, when the school was decadent, arose 四明 Ciming, under whom there came the division of 山家 Hill or Tiantai School and 山外 the School outside, the latter following 悟恩 Wuen and in time dying out; the former, a more profound school, adhered to Ciming; it was from this school that the Tiantai doctrine spread to Japan. The three principal works of the Tiantai founder are called 天台三部, i. e. 玄义 exposition of the deeper meaning of the Lotus; 文句 exposition of its text; and 止观 meditation; the last was directive and practical; it was in the line of Bodhidharma, stressing the 'inner light'.The Tiantai or Heavenly Terrace mountain, the location of the Tiantai sect; its name is attributed to the 三台 six stars at the foot of Ursa Major, under which it is supposed to be, but more likely because of its height and appearance.

The small, or inferior wain, or vehicle; the form of Buddhism which developed after kyamuni's death to about the beginning of the Christian era, when Mahyna doctrines were introduced. It is the orthodox school and more in direct line with the Buddhist succession than Mahynism which developed on lines fundamentally different. The Buddha was a spiritual doctor, less interested in philosophy than in the remedy for human misery and perpetual transmigration. He "turned aside from idle metaphysical speculations; if he held views on such topics, he deemed them valueless for the purposes of salvation, which was his goal" (Keith). Metaphysical speculations arose after his death, and naturally developed into a variety of Hnayna schools before and after the separation of a distinct school of Mahyna. Hnayna remains the form in Ceylon, Burma, and Siam, hence is known as Southern Buddhism in contrast with Northern Buddhism or Mahyna, the form chiefly prevalent from Nepal to Japan. Another rough division is that of Pali and Sanskrit, Pali being the general literary language of the surviving form of Hnayna, Sanskrit of Mahyna. The term Hnayna is of Mahynist origination to emphasize the universalism and altruism of Mahyna over the narrower personal salvation of its rival. According to Mahyna teaching its own aim is universal Buddhahood, which means the utmost development of wisdom and the perfect transformation of all the living in the future state; it declares that Hnayna, aiming at arhatship and pratyekabuddhahood, seeks the destruction of body and mind and extinction in nirva. For arhatship the 四谛Four Noble Truths are the foundation teaching, for pratyekabuddhahood the 十二因缘 twelve-nidnas, and these two are therefore sometimes styled the two vehicles 二乘. Tiantai sometimes calls them the (Hnayna) Tripiaka school. Three of the eighteen Hnayna schools were transported to China: 舍 (Abhidharma) Koa; 成实 Satya-siddhi; and the school of Harivarman, the律 Vinaya school. These are described by Mahynists as the Buddha's adaptable way of meeting the questions and capacity of his hearers, though his own mind is spoken of as always being in the absolute Mahyna all-embracing realm. Such　is the Mahyna view of Hnayna, and if the Vaipulya stras and special scriptures of their school, which are repudiated by Hnayna, are apocryphal, of which there seems no doubt, then Mahyna in condemning Hnayna must find other support for its claim to orthodoxy. The stras on which it chiefly relies, as regards the Buddha, have no authenticity; while those of Hnayna cannot be accepted as his veritable teaching in the absence of fundamental research. Hnayna is said to have first been divided into minority and majority sections immediately after the death of kyamuni, when the sthvira, or older disciples, remained in what is spoken of as "the cave", some place at Rjagha, to settle the future of the order, and the general body of disciples remained outside; these two are the first 上坐部 and 大部 q. v. The first doctrinal division is reported to have taken place under the leadership of the monk 大天 Mahdeva (q.v.) a hundred years after the Buddha's nirva and during the reign of Aoka; his reign, however, has been placed later than this by historians. Mahdeva's sect became the Mahsghik, the other the Sthvira. In time the two are said to have divided into eighteen, which with the two originals are the so-called "twenty sects" of Hnayna. Another division of four sects, referred to by Yijing, is that of the 大部 (Arya) Mahsaghanikya, 上座部 ryasthavir, 根本说一切有部 Mlasarvstivda, and 正量部 Samaty. There is still another division of five sects, 五部律. For the eighteen Hnayna sects see 小乘十八部.The three characteristic marks of all Hnayna stras: the impermanence of phenomena, the unreality of the ego, and nirva.The nine classes of works belonging to the Hnayna, i.e. the whole of the twelve discourses; the Vaipulya, or broader teaching; and the Vykaraa, or prophesies.The 上座部 Sthaviravdin, School of Presbyters, and 大部 Sarvstivdin, q.v.The Hnayna partial and gradual method of obeying laws and commandments, as compared with the full and immediate salvation of Mahyna.A Chinese list of the "eighteen" sects of the Hnayna, omitting Mahsghik, Sthavira, and Sarvstivdah as generic schools: I. 大部 The Mahsghik is divided into eight schools as follows: (1) 一说部 Ekavyavahrik; (2) 说出世部 Lokottaravdina; (3) 鸡胤部 Kaukkuik (Gokulik); (4) 多闻部 Bahuruty; (5) 说假部 Prajptivadina; (6) 制多山部 Jetavaniy, or Caityaail; (7) 西山住部 Aparaail; (8) 北山住部 Uttaraail. II. 上坐部 ryasthavir, or Sthviravdin, divided into eight schools: (1) 雪山部 Haimavat. The 说一切有部 Sarvstivda gave rise to (2) 犊子部 Vtsputry, which gave rise to (3) 法上部 Dharmottary; (4) 贤胄部 Bhadrayny; (5) 正量部 Samaty; and (6) 密林山 Saagarik; (7) 化地部 Mahsak produced (8) 法藏部 Dharmagupt. From the Sarvstivdins arose also (9) 光部 Kyapy and (10) 经量部 Sautrntik. v. 宗轮论. Cf Keith, 149-150. The division of the two schools is ascribed to Mahdeva a century after the Nirva. Under I the first five are stated as arising two centuries after the Nirva, and the remaining three a century later, dates which are unreliable. Under II, the Haimavat and the Sarvstivda are dated some 200 years after the Nirva; from the Sarvstivdins soon arose the Vtsputryas, from whom soon sprang the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth; then from the Sarvstivdins there arose the seventh which gave rise to the eighth, and again, nearing the 400th year, the Sarvstivdins gave rise to the ninth and soon after the tenth. In the list of eighteen the Sarvstivdah is not counted, as it split into all the rest.Tiantai's division of Hnayna into four schools or doctrines: (1) 有门 Of reality, the existence of all phenomena, the doctrine of being (cf. 发智六足论, etc.); (2) 空门 of unreality, or non-existence (cf. 成实论); (3) 亦有亦空门 of both, or relativity of existence and non-existence (cf. 毗勒论); (4) 非有非空 of neither, or transcending existence and non-existence (cf. 迦旃延经).Hnayna and the heretical sects; also, Hnayna is a heretical sect.The commandments of the Hnayna, also recognized by the Mahyna: the five, eight, and ten commandments, the 250 for the monks, and the 348 for the nuns.The Hnayna stras, the four sections of the gamas 阿含经 v. 小乘九部.The Hnayna stras or Abhidharma.The philosophical canon of the Hnayna, now supposed to consist of some thirty-seven works, the earliest of which is said to be the Guanirdea <foreign lang="sa">stra</foreign>, tr. as 分别功德论 before A.D. 220.

T., hjamdpal; J., Monju. Origin unknown; presumably, like most Buddhas and bodhisattvas, an idealization of a particular quality, in his case of Wisdom. Maju is beautiful, r; good fortune, virtue, majesty, lord, an epithet of a god. Six definitions are obtained from various scriptures: 妙首 (or 头 ) wonderful or beautiful) head; 普首 universal head; 濡首 glossy head (probably a transliteration); 敬首 revered head; 妙德 wonderful virtue (or power); 妙吉祥 wonderfully auspicious; the last is a later translation in the 西域记. As guardian of wisdom 智慧 he is often placed on kyamuni's left, with 普显 on the right as guardian of law 理, the latter holding the Law, the former the wisdom or exposition of it; formerly they held the reverse positions. He is often represented with five curls or waves to his hair indicating the 五智 q. v. or the five peaks; his hand holds the sword of wisdom and he sits on a lion emblematic of its stern majesty: but he has other forms. He is represented as a youth, i. e. eternal youth. His present abode is given as east of the universe, known as 凉山 clear and cool mountain, or a region 宝住 precious abode, or Abode of Treasures, or 宝氏 from which he derives one of his titles, 宝相如来. One of his <foreign lang="sa">dhra</foreign>s prophesies China as his post-nirva realm. In past incarnations he is described as being the parent of many Buddhas and as having assisted the Buddha into existence; his title was 龙种上佛 the supreme Buddha of the <foreign lang="sa">nga</foreign>s, also 大身佛 or 神仙佛; now his title is 欢喜藏摩尼宝精佛 The spiritual Buddha who joyfully cares for the jewel: and his future title is to be 普现佛 Buddha universally revealed. In the 序品 Introductory Chapter of the <title>Lotus Sutra</title> he is also described as the ninth predecessor or Buddha-ancestor of kyamuni. He is looked on as the chief of the Bodhisattvas and represents them, as the chief disciple of the Buddha, or as his son 法王子. Hnayna counts riputra as the wisest of the disciples, Mahyna gives Majur the chief place, hence he is also styled 觉母 mother, or begetter of understanding. He is shown riding on either a lion or a peacock, or sitting on a white lotus; often he holds a book, emblem of wisdom, or a blue lotus; in certain rooms of a monastery he is shown as a monk; and he appears in military array as defender of the faith. His signs, magic words, and so on, are found in various sutras. His most famous centre in China is Wu-tai shan in Shansi. where he is the object of pilgrimages, especially of Mongols. The legends about him are many. He takes the place in Buddhism of Vivakarman as Vulcan, or architect, of the universe. He is one of the eight Dhyni-bodhisattvas, and sometimes has the image of Akobhya in his crown. He was mentioned in China as early as the fourth century and in the <title>Lotus Sutra</title> he frequently appears, especially as the converter of the daughter of the Dragon-king of the Ocean. He has five messengers 五使者 and eight youths 八童子 attending on him. His hall in the Garbhadhtu maala is the seventh, in which his group numbers twenty-five. His position is northeast. There are numerous sutras and other works with his name as title, e. g. 文殊师利问菩提经 Gayara stra, tr. by Kumrajva 384-417: and its 论 or .Tk of Vasubandhu, tr. by Bodhiruci 535. see list in B.

Convenient to the place, or situation, suited to the condition, opportune, appropriate; but 方 is interpreted as 方法 method, mode, plan, and 便 as 便用 convenient for use, i. e. a convenient or expedient method; also 方 as 方正 and 便 as 巧妙, which implies strategically correct. It is also intp. as 权道智 partial, temporary, or relative (teaching of) knowledge of reality, in contrast with 般若智 praj, and 实 absolute truth, or reality instead of the seeming. The term is a translation of 伛和 upya, a mode of approach, an expedient, stratagem, device. The meaning is-- teaching according to the capacity of the hearer, by any suitable method, including that of device or stratagem, but expedience beneficial to the recipient is understood. Mahyna claims that the Buddha used this expedient or partial method in his teaching until near the end of his days, when he enlarged it to the revelation of reality, or the preaching of his final and complete truth; Hnayna with reason denies this, and it is evident that the Mahyna claim has no foundation, for the whole of its 方等 or 方广 scriptures are of later invention. Tiantai speaks of the 三乘 q. v. or Three Vehicles as 方便 expedient or partial revelations, and of its 一乘 or One Vehicle as the complete revelation of universal Buddhahood. This is the teaching of the <title>Lotus Sutra</title>, which itself contains 方便 teaching to lead up to the full revelation; hence the terms 体 (or 同体 ) 方便, i. e. expedient or partial truths within the full revelation, meaning the expedient part of the Lotus, and   体外方便 the expedient or partial truths of the teaching which preceded the Lotus; see the 方便品 of that work, also the second chapter of the 维摩经. 方便 is also the seventh of the ten pramits.Expedient gates or ways of using the seeming for the real.An intermediate 'land 'of the Japanese monk 见 Kenshin, below the Pure-land, where Amitbha appears in his transformation-body.Abbreviation for the last and next but one.<term lang="sa">upya-jna</term>; the wisdom or knowledge of using skilful means (for saving others).One of the Tiantai 四土 Four Lands, which is temporary, as its occupants still have remains to be purged away.The right of great Bodhisattvas, knowing every one's karma, to kill without sinning, e. g. in order to prevent a person from committing sin involving unintermitted suffering, or to aid him in reaching one of the higher reincarnations.<foreign lang="sa">upya</foreign>, the seventh <foreign lang="sa">pramit</foreign>.A bodhisattva in the Garbhadhtu group, the second on the right in the hall of Space.Though the Buddha is eternal, he showed himself as temporarily extinct, as necessary to arouse a longing for Buddha, cf.

The term covers the whole of the specifically Mahyna sutras. The sutras are also known as 无量义经 scriptures of measureless meaning, i. e. universalistic, or the infinite. Cf. 方等.A <foreign lang="sa">vaipulya</foreign> sutra, the Lalita-vistara, in 12 chuan, giving an account of the Buddha in the Tuita heaven and his descent to earth as kyamuni: tr. by Divkara under the Tang dynasty; another tr. is the 普曜经.Heretical followers of Mahyna, who hold a false doctrine of 空 the Void, teaching it as total non-existence, or nihilism.A monk's robe 袈裟 said to be so called because of its square appearance; also 方袍.Square, four square, one of the five shapes.<foreign lang="sa">vaipulya</foreign>; cf. 方广. 方 is interpreted as referring to the doctrine, 等 as equal, or universal, i. e. everynwhere equally. An attempt is made to distinguish between the two above terms, 方广 being now used for <foreign lang="sa">vaipulya</foreign>, but they are interchangeable. Eitel says the <foreign lang="sa">vaipulya</foreign> sutras 'are distinguished by an expansion of doctrine and style (Stras developes, Burnouf). They are apparently of later date, showing the influence of different schools; their style is diffuse and prolix, repeating the same idea over and over again in prose and in verse; they are also frequently interlarded with prophecies and <foreign lang="sa">dhra</foreign>s'; but the two terms seem to refer rather to the content than the form. The content is that of universalism. Chinese Buddhists assert that all the sutras from the 华严 Huayan onwards are of this class and therefore are Mahyna.

Some are styled 乞士 mendicant scholars, all are 释种 kya-seed, offspring of Buddha. The Chinese characters are clearly used as a phonetic equivalent, but many attempts have been made to give meanings to the two words, e. g. 比 as 破 and 丘 as 烦恼, hence one who destroys the passions and delusions, also □能 able to overawe Mra and his minions; also 除馑 to get rid of dearth, moral and spiritual. Two kinds 乞 and 外乞; both indicate self-control, the first by internal mental or spiritual methods, the second by externals such as strict diet. □刍 is a fragrant plant, emblem of the monastic life.An authoritative assembly of at least four monks; idem 僧伽.□刍尼; 尼姑 <foreign lang="sa">bhiku</foreign>. A nun, or almswoman. The first woman to be ordained was the Buddha's aunt Mahprajpat, who had nursed him. In the fourteenth year after his enlightenment the Buddha yielded to persuasion and admitted his aunt and women to his order of religious mendicants, but said that the admission of women would shorten the period of Buddhism by 500 years. The nun, however old, must acknowledge the superiority of every monk; must never scold him or tell his faults; must never accuse him, though he may accuse her; and must in all respects obey the rules as commanded by him. She accepts all the rules for the monks with additional rules for her own order. Such is the theory rather than the practice. The title by which Mahprajpat was addressed was applied to nuns, i. e. <foreign lang="sa">rya</foreign>, or noble, 阿姨, though some consider the Chinese term entirely native.The nun's '500 rules' and the eight commanding respect for monks, cf. 五百戒 and 八敬戒; also 比丘尼戒本 and other works; the 比丘尼僧只律波罗提木叉戒经 <title>Bhiku-sghika-vinaya-prtimoka-stra</title> was tr. by Faxian and also by Buddhabhadra.piaka-koa. i. e. 藏 a thesaurus, treasury, store.A monastery five <foreign lang="zh">li</foreign> west of Khotan where Laozi is said to have converted the Huns to Buddhism.idem. 类智 q. v.(比罗娑落山) Plusragiri, 象坚山 Hill firm as an elephant, a mountain southwest of the capital of Kapi, 'the tutelary deity of which was converted by Sakvamuni.'

"An inexhaustible number" of "seeds" are "stored up in the laya-soul; they manifest themselves in innumerable varieties of existence, both physical and mental". "Though there are infinite varieties. . . they all participate in the prime nature of the <foreign lang="sa">laya</foreign>." Anesaki. The Faxiang School is one of the "eight schools", and was established in China on the return of Xuanzang, consequent on his translation of the Yogcrya works. Its aim is to understand the principle underlying the 万法性相 or nature and characteristics of all things. Its foundation works are the 解深密经, the 唯识论, and the 瑜伽论. It is one of the Mahyna realistic schools, opposed by the idealistic schools, e.g. the 三论 school; yet it was a "combination of realism and idealism, and its religion a profoundly mystic one".

'Liberation, eternal bliss'; '(with Buddhists and Jainas) absolute extinction or annihilation, complete extinction of individual existence.' M.W. Other forms are 涅盘那; 泥日; 泥洹; 泥畔 Originally translated 灭 to extinguish, extinction, put out (as a lamp or fire), it was also described as 解脱 release, 寂灭 tranquil extinction; 无 inaction, without effort, passiveness; 不生 no (re)birth; 安乐 calm joy; 灭度transmigration to 'extinction'. The meaning given to 'extinction' varies, e.g. individual extinction; cessation of rebirth; annihilation of passion; extinction of all misery and entry into bliss. While the meaning of individual extinction is not without advocates, the general acceptation is the extinction or end of all return to reincarnation with its concomitant suffering, and the entry into bliss. Nirva may be enjoyed in the present life as an attainable state, with entry into <foreign lang="sa">parinirva</foreign>, or perfect bliss to follow. It may be (a) with a 'remainder', i.e. the cause but not all the effect (karma), of reincarnation having been destroyed; (b) without 'remainder', both cause and effect having been extinguished. The answer of the Buddha as to the continued personal existence of the Tathgata in nirva is, in the Hnayna canon, relegated 'to the sphere of the indeterminates' (Keith), as one of the questions which are not essential to salvation. One argument is that flame when blown out does not perish but returns to the totality of Fire. The <title>Nirva Sutra</title> claims for nirva the ancient ideas of 常乐我净 permanence, bliss, personality purity in the transcendental realm. Mahyna declares that Hnayna by denying personality in the transcendental realm denies the existence of the Buddha. In Mahyna final nirva is transcendental, and is also used as a term for the absolute.

By some 盆 is regarded as a Chinese word, not part of the transliteration, meaning a vessel filled with offerings of food. The term is applied to the festival of All Souls, held about the 15th of the 7th moon, when masses are read by Buddhist and Taoist priests and elaborate offerings made to the Buddhist Trinity for the purpose of releasing from purgatory the souls of those who have died on land or sea. The <title>Ullambanaptra Sutra</title> is attributed to kyamuni, of course incorrectly; it was first tr. into Chinese by Dharmaraksha, A.D. 266-313 or 317; the first masses are not reported until the time of Liang Wudi, A.D. 538; and were popularized by Amogha (A.D. 732) under the influence of the Yogcrya School. They are generally observed in China, but are unknown to Southern Buddhism. The "idea of intercession on the part of the priesthood for the benefit of" souls in hell "is utterly antagonistic to the explicit teaching of primitive Buddhism'" The origin of the custom is unknown, but it is foisted on to kyamuni, whose disciple Maudgalyyana is represented as having been to purgatory to relieve his mother's sufferings. kyamuni told him that only the united efforts of the whole priesthood 十方会 could alleviate the pains of the suffering. The mere suggestion of an All Souls Day with a great national day for the monks is sufficient to account for the spread of the festival. Eitel says: "Engrafted upon the narrative ancestral worship, this ceremonial for feeding the ghost of deceased ancestors of seven generations obtained immense popularity and is now practised by everybody in China, by Taoists even and by Confucianists."

Adopted by Buddhists for <term lang="sa">dhyna</term>, 禅 or 禅那, i.e. meditation, abstraction, trance. <foreign lang="sa">dhyna</foreign> is 'meditation, thought, reflection, especially profound and abstract religious contemplation'.

The term also connotes Buddhism and Buddhist things in general, but has special application to the 禅宗 q.v. It is one of the six <foreign lang="sa">pramit</foreign>s, cf. 波. There are numerous methods and subjects of meditation. The eighteen <foreign lang="sa">brahmaloka</foreign>s are divided into four <foreign lang="sa">dhyna</foreign> regions 'corresponding to certain frames of mind where individuals might be reborn in strict accordance with their spiritual state'. The first three are the first <foreign lang="sa">dhyna</foreign>, the second three the second <foreign lang="sa">dhyna</foreign>, the third three the third <foreign lang="sa">dhyna</foreign>, and the remaining nine the fourth <foreign lang="sa">dhyna</foreign>. See Eitel. According to Childers' <title>Pali Dictionary</title>, 'The four <foreign lang="pi">jhna</foreign>s are four stages of mystic meditation, whereby the believer's mind is purged from all earthly emotions, and detached as it were from his body, which remains plunged in a profound trance.' Seated cross-legged, the practiser 'concentrates his mind upon a single thought. Gradually his soul becomes filled with a supernatural ecstasy and serenity', his mind still reasoning: this is the first <foreign lang="pi">jhna</foreign>. Concentrating his mind on the same subject, he frees it from reasoning, the ecstasy and serenity remaining, which is the second <foreign lang="pi">jhna</foreign>. Then he divests himself of ecstasy, reaching the third stage of serenity. Lastly, in the fourth stage the mind becomes indifferent to all emotions, being exalted above them and purified.

Cf. 楞 13 <title>Lakvatra stra</title>. This sect, believing in direct enlightenment, disregarded ritual and <foreign lang="sa">stra</foreign>s and depended upon the inner light and personal influence for the propagation of its tenets, founding itself on the esoteric tradition supposed to have been imparted to Kyapa by the Buddha, who indicated his meaning by plucking a flower without further explanation. Kyapa smiled in apprehension and is supposed to have passed on this mystic method to the patriarchs. The successor of Bodhidharma was 慧可 Huike, and he was succeeded by 僧璨 Sengcan; 道信 Daoxin; 弘忍 Hongren; 慧能 Huineng, and 神秀 Shenxiu, the sect dividing under the two latter into the southern and northern schools: the southern school became prominent, producing 南岳 Nanyue and 原 Qingyuan, the former succeeded by 马祖 Mazu, the latter by 石头 Shitou.

The doctrine that all phenomena and the ego have no reality, but are composed of a certain number of <foreign lang="sa">skandha</foreign>s or elements, which disintegrate. The void, the sky, space. The universal, the absolute, complete abstraction without relativity. There are classifications into 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 11, 13, 16, and 18 categories. The doctrine is that all things are compounds, or unstable organisms, possessing no self-essence, i.e. are dependent, or caused, come into existence only to perish. The underlying reality, the principle of eternal relativity, or non-infinity, i.e. <foreign lang="sa">nya</foreign>, permeates all phenomena making possible their evolution. From this doctrine the Yogcrya school developed the idea of the permanent reality, which is Essence of Mind, the unknowable noumenon behind all phenomena, the entity void of ideas and phenomena, neither matter nor mind, but the root of both.

Before the differentiation of the sexes birth is supposed to have been by transformation. The term is also applied to beings enclosed in unopened lotuses in paradise, who have not had faith in Amitbha but trusted to their own strength to attain salvation; there they remain for proportionate periods, happy, but without the presence of the Buddha, or Bodhisattvas, or the sacred host, and do not hear their teaching. The condition is known as 胎宫, the womb-palace.Garbhadhtu, or Garbhakoa-(dhtu), the womb treasury, the universal source from which all things are produced; the matrix; the embryo; likened to a womb in which all of a child is conceived-- its body, mind, etc. It is container and content; it covers and nourishes; and is the source of all supply. It represents the 理性 fundamental nature, both material elements and pure <foreign lang="sa">bodhi</foreign>, or wisdom in essence or purity; 理 being the <foreign lang="sa">garbhadhtu</foreign> as fundamental wisdom, and 智 acquired wisdom or knowledge, the <foreign lang="sa">vajradhtu</foreign>. It also represents the human heart in its innocence or pristine purity, which is considered as the source of all Buddha-pity and moral knowledge. And it indicates that from the central being in the <foreign lang="sa">maala</foreign>, viz. the Sun as symbol of Vairocana, there issue all the other manifestations of wisdom and power, Buddhas, bodhisattvas, demons, etc. It is 本觉 original intellect, or the static intellectuality, in contrast with 始觉 intellection, the initial or dynamic intellectuality represented in the <foreign lang="sa">vajradhtu</foreign>; hence it is the 因 cause and <foreign lang="sa">vajradhtu</foreign> the 果 effect; though as both are a unity, the reverse may be the rule, the effect being also the cause; it is also likened to 利他 enriching others, as <foreign lang="sa">vajradhtu</foreign> is to 自利 enriching self. Kb Daishi, founder of the Yoga or Shingon 言 School in Japan, adopted the representation of the ideas in <foreign lang="sa">maala</foreign>s, or diagrams, as the best way of revealing the mystic doctrine to the ignorant. The <foreign lang="sa">garbhadhtu</foreign> is the womb or treasury of all things, the universe; the 理 fundamental principle, the source; its symbols are a triangle on its base, and an open lotus as representing the sun and Vairocana. In Japan this <foreign lang="sa">maala</foreign> is placed on the east, typifying the rising sun as source, or 理. The <foreign lang="sa">vajradhtu</foreign> is placed west and represents 智 wisdom or knowledge as derived from 理 the underlying principle, but the two are essential one to the other, neither existing apart. The material and spiritual; wisdom-source and intelligence; essence and substance; and similar complementary ideas are thus portrayed; the <foreign lang="sa">garbhadhtu</foreign> may be generally considered as the static and the <foreign lang="sa">vajradhtu</foreign> as the dynamic categories, which are nevertheless a unity. The <foreign lang="sa">garbhadhtu</foreign> is divided into 三部 three sections representing <foreign lang="sa">samdhi</foreign> or quiescence, wisdom-store, and pity-store, or thought, knowledge, pity; one is called the Buddha-section, the others the Vajra and Lotus sections respectively; the three also typify <foreign lang="sa">vimoka</foreign>, <foreign lang="sa">praj</foreign>, and <foreign lang="sa">dharmakya</foreign>, or freedom, understanding, and spirituality. There are three heads of these sections, i. e. Vairocana, Vajrapi, and Avalokitevara; each has a mother or source, e. g. Vairocana from Buddha's-eye; and each has a 明王 or emanation of protection against evil; also a <foreign lang="sa">akti</foreign> or female energy; a germ-letter, etc. The diagram of five Buddhas contains also four bodhisattvas, making nine in all, and there are altogether thirteen 大院 or great courts of various types of ideas, of varying numbers, generally spoken of as 414.

The Buddha of infinite qualities, known as 阿弥陀婆 (or 阿弥陀佛) Amitbha, tr. 无量光 boundless light; 阿弥陀□斯Amityus, tr. 无量寿　boundless age, or life; and among the esoteric sects Amta 甘露 (甘露王) sweet-dew (king). An imaginary being unknown to ancient Buddhism, possibly of Persian or Iranian origin, who has eclipsed the historical Buddha in becoming the most popular divinity in the Mahyna pantheon. His name indicates an idealization rather than an historic personality, the idea of eternal light and life. The origin and date of the concept are unknown, but he has always been associated with the west, where in his Paradise, Suikhvat, the Western Pure Land, he receives to unbounded happiness all who call upon his name (cf. the Pure Lands 净土 of Maitreya and Akobhya). This is consequent on his forty-eight vows, especially the eighteenth, in which he vows to refuse Buddhahood until he has saved all living beings to his Paradise, except those who had committed the five unpardonable sins, or were guilty of blasphemy against the Faith. While his Paradise is theoretically only a stage on the way to rebirth in the final joys of nirvana, it is popularly considered as the final resting-place of those who cry <foreign lang="sa">na-mo a-mi-to-fo</foreign>, or blessed be, or adoration to, Amita Buddha. The 净土 Pure-land (Jap. Jdo) sect is especially devoted to this cult, which arises chiefly out of the <title>Sukhvatvyha</title>, but Amita is referred to in many other texts and recognized, with differing interpretations and emphasis, by the other sects. Eitel attributes the first preaching of the dogma to 'a priest from Tokhara' in A. D.147, and says that Faxian and Xuanzang make no mention of the cult. But the Chinese pilgrim 慧日Huiri says he found it prevalent in India 702-719. The first translation of the <title>Amityus Sutra</title>, circa A.D. 223-253, had disappeared when the Kaiyuan catalogue was compiled A.D. 730. The eighteenth vow occurs in the tr. by Dharmaraka A.D. 308. With Amita is closely associated Avalokitevara, who is also considered as his incarnation, and appears crowned with, or bearing the image of Amita. In the trinity of Amita, Avalokitevara appears on his left and Mahsthmaprpta on his right. Another group, of five, includes Kitigarbha and Ngrjuna, the latter counted as the second patriarch of the Pure Land sect. One who calls on the name of Amitbha is styled 阿弥陀圣 a saint of Amitbha. Amitbha is one of the Five '<foreign lang="sa">dhyni</foreign> buddhas' 五佛, q.v. He has many titles, amongst which are the following twelve relating to him as Buddha of light, also his title of eternal life: 无量光佛Buddha of boundless light; 无边光佛 Buddha of unlimited light; 无碍光佛 Buddha of irresistible light; 无对光佛 Buddha of incomparable light; 焰王光佛 Buddha of <foreign lang="sa">yama</foreign> or flame-king light; 净光佛 Buddha of pure light; 欢喜光佛 Buddha of joyous light; 智慧光佛 Buddha of wisdom light; 不断光佛 Buddha of unending light; 难思光佛 Buddha of inconceivable light; 无称光佛Buddha of indescribable light; 超日月光佛 Buddha of light surpassing that of sun and moon; 无量寿 Buddha of boundless age. As buddha he has, of course, all the attributes of a buddha, including the <foreign lang="sa">trikya</foreign>, or 法报化身, about which in <foreign lang="la">
