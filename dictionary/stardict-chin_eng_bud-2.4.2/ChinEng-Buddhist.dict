ekayāna, One yāna, the One yāna, the vehicle of one-ness.	[Soothill]

'Single vehicle' (eka-yāna). A term used to indicate the doctrine that there is only one teaching, which is the expedient means to attract people to the Single Buddha vehicle. Since this single vehicle teaching is the teaching of becoming a Buddha, it is also called the 'bodhisattva vehicle' 菩薩乘, the 'Buddha vehicle' 佛乘 and the Great Vehicle 大乘. The Faxiang 法相 school interprets this bodhisattva vehicle of the three vehicle 三乘 system as the 'one vehicle' or 'buddha vehicle.' According to Kuiji's 窺基 explanation, the ekayāna teaching of the Faxiang school has two levels, 攝入大乘 and 出生大乘. The former is the expedient to attract people of undermined nature (不定性) to the Single Buddha vehicle. Because of the existence of sentient beings incapable of Buddhahood, this teaching does not fully correspond with the meaning of single vehicle. But since all members of the audience in the Lotus Sutra 法華經 have the potential to become Buddha, this teaching is true and effective in that situation. The latter means that all teachings of Buddha are 'born' from a single Mahāyāna teaching. Kuiji says that this is the teaching of the Śrīmālā-sūtra 勝鬘經 and the Nirvana Sutra 涅槃經. In Huayan 華嚴 and Tiantai 天台, there is a distinction between this one Buddha vehicle and the bodhisattva vehicle of the three vehicles.	[EngBuddhist]

The Yiqie mimi zuishang mingyi dajiaowang yigui; Skt. Sarvarahasya-nāma-tantrarāja; Tib. hams cad gsang ba shes bya ba rgyud kyi gyal po; (Secret Meanings of All the Names: Great King of Tantras) To.481, P.114); 2 fasc. (T 888.18.536-541), abbr. Tantra of the Secret Meanings of the Names 秘密名儀軌, translated by Dānapāla 施護 in 1009 CE. An explanatory continuation (akhyānatantra) of the Tattvasaṃgraha 真實攝經 (T 882). Most of the text comments on the significance of various yoga-related concepts (the four mudrās 四印, procedures for samādhi, etc.) and the names of the Tattvasaṃgraha's 37 divinities. There is an ongoing polemic against conventional ethics and the performance of rites, which are seen as useless in the pursuit of liberation. Instead the text emphasizes radical mind-based methods, such as seeing lust, hatred and delusion (rāga, dveśa, moha 貪嗔痴) as none other than tathāgatas -- an approach which is standard for later Buddhist esotericism, particularly the Guhyasamāja 秘密集會 (T 885). In this connection, there appears an infamous, oft-quoted passage which appears to advocate killing sentient beings, lying, stealing and adultery; Dānapāla's version obfuscates this passage (T 888.18.538b13-14) and others completely, also bowdlerizing several terms concerning sexual yoga (eg. liṅga is "joiner" 相者; bhaga is "destroyer" 破者). However, it is notable that the monk Ratnākaraśānti also neuters this language in his commentary, the Śrīsarvarahasyanibaṃdho-rahaḥpradīpo-nāma (To.2623, P.3450); eg. one should kill the idea of sentient beings. For an Eng. tr. of this, the sole Indian commentary, along with the full text from Tib., see Wayman (1984); for an early Japanese study of the Tibetan version, see Toganō (1953).

Ippen was born in present-day Ehime prefecture and studied at an early age with a disciple of Hōnen 法然. He left the priesthood once to return to the secular world, but later reversed this decision. After a pilgrimage to Zenkōji 善光寺 in Nagano prefecture, he went to a secluded temple in Ehime, where he carried out rigorous religious practice, and eventually had an experience of intimate unity with Amitābha Buddha 阿彌陀佛. He became convinced through this experience that no matter what one's degree of religious preparation, he or she could be reborn in the Pure Land by virtue of even one recitation of Amitābha's name. He subsequently wandered throughout the country, handing out slips of paper to people with basic instructions for his style of Pure Land practice. He is said to have converted thousands. Approaching death at the age of 51, he burned all of his own writings, and thus none of his works survive.	[EngBuddhist]

(一闡提迦) icchantika. Also 一顚迦, 阿闡底迦 One without desire for Buddha enlightenment; an unbeliever; shameless, an enemy of the good; full of desires; 斷善根者 one who has cut off his roots of goodness; it is applied also to a bodhisattva who has made a vow not to become a Buddha until all beings are saved. This is called 大悲闡提 the icchantika of great mercy.	[Soothill]

(icchantika). A transliteration of the Sanskrit term icchantika. Also translated into Chinese as duanshangen 斷善根 'one who has cut off the good roots' and xinbujuzu 信不具足 'lacking in the necessary faith.' A person whose roots of goodness are cut off and therefore cannot be saved. Someone who cannot attain enlightenment no matter how strenuously they practice. The term icchan originally refers to someone who is in a continual state of craving. In India the term refers to an Epicurean or a secularist. In Buddhism it refers to someone who lacks the basic causes and conditions for becoming a Buddha. The theory of the existence of such people was taught by the Yogacara school. Buddhist schools such as Tiantai 天台, Huayan 華嚴 etc., disagreed with this theory, teaching that all beings can become buddhas. This becomes the source of debate in later East Asian Buddhism, and is discussed at length in the "Buddha-nature Treatise" (佛性論).	[EngBuddhist]

Triyāna, the three vehicles, or conveyances which carry living beings across saṁsāra or mortality (births-and-deaths) to the shores of nirvāṇa. The three are styled 小,中, and 大. Sometimes the three vehicles are defined as 聲聞 Śrāvaka, that of the hearer or obedient disciple; 緣覺Pratyeka-buddha, that of the enlightened for self; these are described as 小乘 because the objective of both is personal salvation; the third is 菩薩Bodhisattva, or 大乘 Mahāyāna, because the objective is the salvation of all the living. The three are also depicted as 三車 three wains, drawn by a goat, a deer, an ox. The Lotus declares that the three are really the One Buddha-vehicle, which has been revealed in three expedient forms suited to his disciples' capacity, the Lotus Sūtra being the unifying, complete, and final exposition. The Three Vehicles are differently explained by different exponents, e.g. (1) Mahāyāna recognizes (a) Śrāvaka, called Hīnayāna, leading in longer or shorter periods to arhatship; (b) Pratyeka-buddha, called Madhyamayāna, leading after still longer or shorter periods to a Buddhahood ascetically attained and for self; (c) Bodhisattva, called Mahayana, leading after countless ages of self-sacrifce in saving others and progressive enlightenment to ultimate Buddhahood. (2) Hīnayāna is also described as possessing three vehicles 聲, 緣, 菩 or 小, 中, 大, the 小 and 中 conveying to personal salvation their devotees in ascetic dust and ashes and mental annihilation, the 大 leading to bodhi, or perfect enlightenment, and the Buddha's way. Further definitions of the Triyāna are: (3) True bodhisattva teaching for the 大; pratyeka-buddha without ignorant asceticism for the 中; and śrāvaka with ignorant asceticism for the 小. (4) (a) 一乘 The One-Vehicle which carries all to Buddhahood: of this the 華嚴 Hua-yen and 法華 Fa-hua are typical exponents; (b) 三乘法 the three-vehicle, containing practitioners of all three systems, as expounded in books of the 深密般若; (c) 小乘 the Hīnayāna pure and simple as seen in the 四阿合經 Four Āgamas. Śrāvakas are also described as hearers of the Four Truths and limited to that degree of development; they hear from the pratyeka-buddhas, who are enlightened in the Twelve Nidānas 因緣; the bodhisattvas make the 六度 or six forms of transmigration their field of sacrificial saving work, and of enlightenment. The Lotus Sūtra really treats the 三乘. Three Vehicles as 方便 or expedient ways, and offers a 佛乘 Buddha Vehicle as the inclusive and final vehicle.	[Soothill]

The "three vehicles" taught by the Mahayana 大乘 schools, which are three programs of practice that are considered to be suitable for different capacities of sentient beings (tri-yāna). These are the vehicles of śrāvaka 聲聞, pratyekabuddha 緣覺 and bodhisattva 菩薩. The first two of these are categorized by the Mahayana schools as lesser vehicles or "hīnayāna 小乘" and are referred to as the "two vehicles 二乘." Mahayana texts such as the Śrīmālā-sūtra 勝鬘經 and the Lotus Sutra 法華經 offer extensive analysis of the relative capacities of these three, with the Lotus Sutra asserting that all three vehicles are eventually subsumed by the single vehicle 一乘.	[EngBuddhist]

The three mystic things: the body, mouth (i.e. voice), and mind of the Tathāgata, which are universal, all things being this mystic body, all sound this mystic voice, and all thought this mystic mind. All creatures in body, voice, and mind are only individualized parts of the Tathāgata, but illusion hides their Tathāgata nature from them. The esoterics seek to realize their Tathāgata nature by physical signs and postures, by voicing of 真言 dhāraṇī and by meditations, so that 入我我入 He may enter me and I Him, which is the perfection of siddhi 悉地; v. 大日經疏 1. 菩提心論.

(2) Inferior, superior and middling mind. 〔俱舍論〕 (3) The three minds of the bodhisattva as explained in the Awakening of Faith 起信論: the true mind that is mindful of suchness; the profound mind which endeavors for wholesome activities and the mind of great compassion that seeks to save all sentient beings. Also: the true mind that transcends calculation; the mind of compassionate expedient means and the subtle mind that remains after the arousal of the prior two. (4) The "three minds" of Yogācāra: the base mind (ālaya 阿賴耶, or eighth consciousness); the provisional base mind (manas 末那, or seventh consciousness) and the mind involved in worldly discriminations (mano 意 or sixth consciousness). 〔五家解說誼HPC 7.14c1-2〕(5) The three minds of progressive observation of the emptiness of self , emptiness of dharmas (objects), and emptiness of both at once, as taught in the Yogācārabhūmi-śāstra. 〔瑜伽論 T 1579.30.605c19-24; 二障義 HPC 1.803a6-9〕(6) Desire, hatred and ignorance.

[Soothill]
(or 三念處). Whether all creatures believe, do not believe, or part believe and part do not believe, the Buddha neither rejoices, nor grieves, but rests in his proper mind and wisdom, i.e. though full of pity, his far-seeing wisdom 正念正智 keeps him above the disturbances of joy and sorrow. 俱舍論 27.

[Soothill]

The three natures. {I} The three natures of perception in Yogācāra: (1) The nature of existence produced from attachment to illusory discrimination. The mind of mistakenly assigning a real essence to those things that are produced from causes and conditions and have no true essence, and the appearance of that mistaken world (parikalpitah-svabhāva; bianji suoyixing 遍計所執性). (2) The nature of existence arising from causes and conditions. All existence is produced according to cause (paratantra-svabhāva; 依他起性; yitaqixing) . (3) The nature of existence being perfectly accomplished; the highest state of existence conforming to ultimate reality (parinispanna-svabhāva; yuanchengshi xing 圓成實性; ).〔成唯識論T 1585.31.45c〕{II} The division of all elemental constructs into three moral qualities: (1) That which produces goodness 善. (2) That which produces evil 惡 and (3) That which is neutral 無記, producing neither good nor evil. The neutral category is further subdivided into two categories of impedimentary neutrality 有覆無記 and non-impedimentary neutrality 無覆無記. The afflictions 煩惱 are included in the evil category.〔俱舍論、 T 1558.29.7b〕	[EngBuddhist]
The differentiation of the three conditions of good, evil, and neutral.	[Soothill]
In the Faxiang sect 法相宗, the use of the three natures 三性 to explain the middle path 中道. According to Consciousness-only 唯識 theory, all dharmas 法 (all existences) are included in these three natures. The nature based on all-pervading discrimination is the dharma expressing the average man's deluded attachments. The existence that is based on accepting the fact that there are regular people is the nature of all-pervading discrimination, though it is not something that is real. This point is called "non being" or "emptiness." In Consciousness-only doctrine, emptiness means non-being, which is quite different from emptiness as understood in the Prajn~āpāramitā sutras, which understand emptiness to mean "that which is ungraspable and unattached." The next, in the nature of existence established according to causal arising, those things which are established according to causal arising are called "dharmas." This is "provisional existence" or "phenomena" (jiayou 假有). It is also called "non-empty." The nature of complete becoming is absolute reality. That is, the essence of existence. This is true existence, and therefore the three time divisions of the teaching (see sanshijiao 三時教) of existence, emptiness and the middle path, are understood as the middle path of going by the three natures, as distinct from a one-sided clinging to existence and a one-sided clinging to emptiness.	[EngBuddhist]
A Tiantai classification of the three delusions, also styled 三煩惱; 三漏; 三垢; 三結; trials or temptations, leakages, uncleannesses, and bonds. The first of the following three is common to all disciples, the two last to bodhisattvas. They arise from (a) 見, 思, 惑 things seen and thought, i.e. illusions from imperfect perception, with temptation to love, hate, etc.; to be rid of these false views and temptations is the discipline and nirvāṇa of ascetic or Hīnayāna Buddhists. Mahāyāna proceeds further in and by its bodhisattva aims, which produce their own difficulties, i.e. (b) 塵沙惑 illusion and temptation through the immense variety of duties in saving men; and (c) 無明惑 illusions and temptations that arise from failure philosophically to understand things in their reality.	[Soothill]

'Three delusions,'three afflictions.' (1) Three kinds of basic defilement: craving (tanyu 貪欲), anger (chenhui 嗔恚), and ignorance (yuchi 愚痴). These are equivalent to the 'three poisons' (sandu 三毒). (2) In Tiantai teaching 天台宗, the three delusions are: delusions arising from incorrect views and thoughts (jiansihuo 見思惑); delusions which hinder knowledge and are as numerous as the number of grains of sand in the Ganges river (chenshahuo 塵沙惑); and delusions which hinder knowledge of reality (wuminghuo 無明惑). The first type of delusion is dealt with by followers of Hīnayāna 小乘 as well as Mahāyāna 大乘. The latter two types are destroyed only by bodhisattvas.	[EngBuddhist]

The 'three non-natures.' In contrast to the 'three natures' of 'attachment to pervasive imagination', 'dependent arising', and 'perfectly accomplished reality', these three non-natures are established from the point of view of the lack of self nature of elements.

Arising, existence, has no self nature. Arising appears dependent upon causes and conditions, and its existence is provisional. (3) 勝義無性shengyiwuxing . The non-nature of ultimate reality.

The three śāstras translated by Kumārajīva, on which the 三論宗 Three śāstra School (Mādhyamika) bases its doctrines, i.e. 中論 Madhyamaka-śāstra, on "the Mean", A.D. 409; 十二門論 Dvādaśanikāya-śāstra, on the twelve points, A.D. 408; 百論 Sata-śāstra, the hundred verses, A.D. 404.	[Soothill]

hree Treatises." An appellation for three important śāstras which served as the foundational texts of a Chinese school which would be referred to by the same name--the "Three Treatise School 三論宗." These three texts are the Madhyamaka-śāstra (Zhong lun 中論) and the Dvādaśanikāya-śāstra (Shiermen lun 十二門論) by Nāgārjuna 龍樹 and the Śata-śāstra (Bai lun) 百論 by his disciple Aryadeva 提婆, all three of which were translated into Chinese by Kumārajīva 鳩摩羅什. The school made significant contributions in the area of the logic of emptiness. The Madhyamaka-śāstra taught the "eight negations" of neither arising nor ceasing 不生不滅 , neither eternal nor not eternal 不常不斷, neither one nor many 不一不異 and neither coming nor going 不來不出. These were used to refute all forms of attachment to concepts of existence and non-existence, and thus the meaning of "middle path" 中道 wherein all things are accepted as existent, but as lacking in self-nature. The Dvādaśanikāya-śāstra also explains the emptiness of all dharmas in twelve sections, and the Śata-śāstra explains emptiness to refute the arguments of non-Buddhist philosophers.##           Kumārajīva passed these texts on to his students Daosheng 道生, Sengzhao 僧肇, and Seng-lang. The last of these distinguished the Sanlun school from the Satyasiddhi school and can thus is sometimes regarded as its actual founder. In the 6th century the most important representatives of this school were Falang and Jizang and under them the Sanlun school experienced a major upsurge. In the 7th century it was brought to Japan by Egwan, a Korean student of Jizang. After the appearance of the Faxiang 法相 school, the Sanlun school decreased in importance.	[EngBuddhist]
The Sanlun, Mādhyamika, or Middle School, founded in India by Nāgārjuna, in China by 嘉祥 Jiaxiang during the reign of 安帝 An Di, Eastern Jin, A.D. 397-419. It flourished up to the latter part of the Tang dynasty. In 625 it was carried to Japan as Sanron. After the death of Jiaxiang, who wrote the 三論玄義, a northern and southern division took place. While the Mādhyamika denied the reality of all phenomenal existence, and defined the noumenal world in negative terms, its aim seems not to have been nihilistic, but the advocacy of a reality beyond human conception and expression, which in our terminology may be termed a spiritual realm.	[Soothill]

The Sanlun zong, or Three-Treatise school. One of the thirteen Chinese schools 十三宗 which held influence during the formative period of East Asian Buddhism, whose most important early representative was Jizang 吉藏. The school was named as such because of its reliance on three Indian śāstras (【參照: 三論】above) which had formed the basis for the Indian Mādhyamika 中觀派 doctrine, and therefore the Sanlun school is seen as the transmission of Mādhyamika thought in China. Although this school would eventually be phased out by native Chinese schools such as Tiantai 天台 and Huayan 華嚴, its rigorous explanations of the logic of emptiness and the middle way would be deeply assimilated into the doctrines of later schools. The Three-treatise school was transmitted to Korea as Samnon chong and to Japan as the Sanron shū.	[EngBuddhist]

trikāya. 三寶身 The threefold body or nature of a Buddha, i.e. the 法, 報, and 化身, or dharmakāya, sambhogakāya, and nirmāṇakāya. The three are defined as 自性, 受用, and 變化, the Buddha-body per se, or in its essential nature; his body of bliss, which he "receives" for his own "use" and enjoyment; and his body of transformation, by which he can appear in any form; i.e. spiritual, or essential; glorified; revealed. While the doctrine of the trikāya is a Mahāyāna concept, it partly results from the Hīnayāna idealization of the earthly Buddha with his thirty-two signs, eighty physical marks, clairvoyance, clairaudience, holiness, purity, wisdom, pity, etc. Mahāyāna, however, proceeded to conceive of Buddha as the Universal, the All, with infinity of forms, yet above all our concepts of unity or diversity. To every Buddha Mahāyāna attributed a three-fold body: that of essential Buddha; that of joy or enjoyment of the fruits of his past saving labours; that of power to transform himself at will to any shape for omnipresent salvation of those who need him. The trinity finds different methods of expression, e.g. Vairocana is entitled 法身, the embodiment of the Law, shining everywhere, enlightening all; Locana is 報身; c.f. 三賓, the embodiment of purity and bliss; Śākyamuni is 化身 or Buddha revealed. In the esoteric sect they are 法 Vairocana, 報 Amitābha, and 化 Śākyamuni. The 三賓 are also 法 dharma, 報 saṅgha, 化 buddha. Nevertheless, the three are considered as a trinity, the three being essentially one, each in the other. (1) 法身 Dharmakāya in its earliest conception was that of the body of the dharma, or truth, as preached by Śākyamuni; later it became his mind or soul in contrast with his material body. In Mādhyamika, the dharmakāya was the only reality, i.e. the void, or the immateria1, the ground of all phenomena; in other words, the 真如 the tathāgatagarbha, the bhūtatathatā. According to the Huayan (Kegon) School it is the 理or noumenon, while the other two are氣or phenomenal aspects. "For the Vijñānavāda... the body of the law as highest reality is the void intelligence, whose infection (saṃkleҫa) results in the process of birth and death, whilst its purification brings about Nirvāṇa, or its restoration to its primitive transparence" (Keith). The "body of the law is the true reality of everything". Nevertheless, in Mahāyāna every Buddha has his own 法身; e.g. in the dharmakāya aspect we have the designation Amitābha, who in his saṃbhogakāya aspect is styled Amitāyus. (2) 報身Sambhogakāya, a Buddha's reward body, or body of enjoyment of the merits he attained as a bodhisattva; in other words, a Buddha in glory in his heaven. This is the form of Buddha as an object of worship. It is defined in two aspects, (a) 自受用身 for his own bliss, and (b) 他受用身 for the sake of others, revealing himself in his glory to bodhisattvas, enlightening and inspiring them. By wisdom a Buddha's dharmakāya is attained, by bodhisattva-merits his saṃbhogakāya. Not only has every Buddha all the three bodies or aspects, but as all men are of the same essence, or nature, as Buddhas, they are therefore potential Buddhas and are in and of the trikāya. Moreover, trikāya is not divided, for a Buddha in his 化身 is still one with his 法身 and 報身, all three bodies being co-existent. (3) 化身; 應身; 應化身 nirmāṇakāya, a Buddha's transformation, or miraculous body, in which he appears at will and in any form outside his heaven, e.g. as Śākyamuni among men.	[Soothill]

(trikāya). The 'three bodies' of the Buddha. (I) Dharmakāya, sambhogakāya, nirmānakāya. (1) The dharmakāya (fashen 法身) is a reference to the transcendence of form and realization of true thusness; (2) the sambhogakāya (baoshen 報身) is the buddha-body that is called 'reward body' or 'body of enjoyment of the merits attained as a bodhisattva'; (3) the nirmānakāya (huashen 化身, yingshen 應身) is the body manifested in response to the need to teach sentient beings. (II) In the Faxiang 法相 school the three bodies are explained in this way: (1) the Buddha body in its self-nature, which is the same as the dharma body; (2) the body which he receives for enjoyment shouyongshen 受用身. Within this is the body received for one's own enjoyment in the transformation into Great Reflecting Wisdom, and the body received for the enjoyment of others in the transformation into the Wisdom of Awareness of Equality. The first one is experienced only in the Buddha realm, while the second is experienced from the first stage of bodhisattva 菩薩 practice and above. (3) The transformation body, by which he can appear in any form. This body is manifested according to the arousal of the wisdom which brings the salvation of sentient beings to fulfillment.##           From this, Buddha-body theory was expanded from three, to four, and even up to ten Buddha- bodies. Among these, the Mahāyāna theory of the three bodies--the Dharma-body, the Reward-body, and the Response-body is most common. The Dharma body 法身 is considered to be the eternal indestructible true principle, the Buddha's original body. The Response body 應身 is considered to be the Buddha's manifest body, but in Mahāyāna Buddhism is regarded as the personification body, which from true principle manifests according to the temperaments and abilities of sentient beings in order to save them.##           The Reward body 報身 (baoshen) is manifest as a combination of the other two, and is therefore not simply eternal true principle, nor simply an impermanent personality. Rather, it is an ideal body possessed by those who have awakened to the true principle based on meritorious practice. It is the living form of the eternal principle, possessing individuality. This is a general explanation, and there have been a large number of interpretations of buddha-body theory offered in the history of Buddhism, among which there are significant differences.

triyāna. 三乘 or 三乘法門 (1) The three vehicles across saṃsāra into nirvāṇa, i.e. the carts offered by the father in the Lotus Sutra to lure his children out of the burning house: (a) goat carts, representing śrāvakas; (b) deer carts, pratyekabuddhas; (c) bullock carts, bodhisattvas. (2) The three principal schools of Buddhism— Hīnayāna, Madhyamayāna, Mahāyāna.	[Soothill]

"Three carts." A metaphor of the Lotus Sutra 法華經, from the story of the 'burning house,' which is as follows: Some chīdren are playing in a house, unaware that it is on fire. Their father induces them to come out by telling them that there are three carts outside, a goat-drawn cart, a deer-drawn cart and an oxcart. When they come out, all there really is, is a great white oxcart. These three carts are metaphors for the śrāvaka 聲聞 vehicle, the pratyekabuddha 緣覺 vehicle, and the bodhisattva vehicle. This story is told in order to explain that although there are "lesser vehicle" and "greater vehicle" in Buddhist teachings, in the final analysis, they are all methods aimed at the same enlightenment. The 'burning house' represents the deluded world of human beings. The chīdren are the practitioners of the three vehicles. The goat cart represents the śrāvaka vehicle, the deer cart represents the pratyekabuddha vehicle, and the ox cart represents the bodhisattva vehicle. When the chīdren have been induced to come out of the house, the large identical white ox carts are prepared outside the gate to give to each chīd. These are metaphors for the great compassion of the Buddha as he discards his expedient means and returns the practitioners to the true single Buddha vehicle. Students of the Lotus Sutra in China were divided into two main groups: one that considered the expedient ox cart and the (fourth) great white ox cart to be the same (therefore positing three vehicles). These were mainly the Faxiang 法相 and Sanlun 三論 schools. The other group, the "four vehicle thinkers" (Hua-yen 華嚴, T'ien-t'ai) 天台 maintained that the expedient ox cart and the great white ox cart are different. That is, the three vehicle thinkers consider the bodhisattva vehicle and the Buddha vehicle to be the same, while the four vehicle thinkers considered them to be different.	[EngBuddhist]

The two earliest sections of Buddhism were this (which developed into the Mahāsthavirāḥ) and the Mahāsānghikāḥ or 大眾部. At first they were not considered to be different schools, the 上座部 merely representing the intimate and older disciples of Śākyamuni and the 大眾 being the rest. It is said that a century later under Mahādeva 大天 a difference of opinion arose on certain doctrines. Three divisions are named as resulting, viz. Mahāvihāravāsinaḥ, Jetavanīyāḥ, and Abhayagiri-vāsinaḥ. These were in Ceylon. In course of time the eighteen Hīnayāna sects were developed. From the time of Aśoka four principal schools are counted as prevailing: Mahāsāṅghika, Sthavira, Mūlasarvāstivda, and Saṁmitīya. The following is a list of the eleven sects reckoned as of the 上座部: 說一切有部; 雪山; 犢子; 法上; 賢冑; 正量; 密林山; 化地; 法藏; 飮光; and 經量部.

The Chinese translation of the Sanskrit Sthaviravāda and Pali Theravāda. One of the earliest schools of Buddhism that developed in India during the century subsequent to the passing away of the Buddha. The name of the sect implies the meaning of "those supporting the teachings of the elders" which means that this was a school that had conservative tendencies--an attempt to conserve the original teachings of the Buddha. They are the longest surviving of the original twenty sects that comprised what is often referred to as Nikāya Buddhism 部派佛教 as they continue to be active to the present in Southeast Asian countries such as Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Thailand and Cambodia. The Theravāda school is known for its early conflict with the more liberal Mahāsāṃghika 大眾部 school, which had espoused a revisionist approach to the Buddhist doctrine. Later schools of Mahayana Buddhism sometimes categorized the Theravāda 上座部 and other Nikāya schools as being lesser vehicle, or Hīnayāna 小乘.	[EngBuddhist]

anirodhānupāda, neither dying nor being reborn, immortal, v. 不生.	[Soothill]
anutpatti; anutpāda. Non-birth: not to be reborn, exempt from rebirth; arhan is mistakenly interpreted as 'not born', meaning not born again into mortal worlds. The 'nir' in nirvana is also erroneously said to mean 'not born'; certain schools say that nothing ever has been born, or created, for all is eternal. The Shingon word 'a' is interpreted as symbolizing the uncreated. The unborn or uncreated is a name for the Tathāgata, who is not born, but eternal ; hence by implication the term means "eternal". ādi, which means"at first, " "beginning","primary", is also interpreted as 不生 uncreated.	[Soothill]

Unborn, unproduced, unarisen. (1) A term for the arhat 阿羅漢, who is no longer producing karma. (2) A synonym for nirvana 涅槃.	[EngBuddhist]
v. 不滅 'Neither (to be) born nor ended' is another term for 常住 permanent, eternal; nothing having been created nothing can be destroyed; Hīnayāna limits the meaning to the state of nirvana, no more births and deaths; Mahāyāna in its Mādhyamika form extends it universally, no birth and death, no creation and annihilation, see 中論.	[Soothill]

(anutpāda-anirodha); 'neither arising nor ceasing.' Since all existences are empty, there is ultimately neither arising nor ceasing. This is one of the fundamental positions of the Mahāyāna schools.	[EngBuddhist]

A Singhalese of northern brahmanic descent, having lost his father, he came at the age of 15 with his uncle to 東海, the eastern sea, or China, where in 718 he became a disciple of 金剛智 Vajrabodhi. After the latter's death in 732, and at his wish, Eliot says in 741, he went to India and Ceylon in search of esoteric or tantric writings, and returned in 746, when he baptized the emperor Xuan Tsung. He was especially noted for rain-making and stilling storms. In 749 he received permission to return home, but was stopped by imperial orders when in the south of China. In ?756 under Su Tsung he was recalled to the capital. His time until 771 was spent translating and editing tantric books in 120 volumes, and the Yogacara 密教 rose to its peak of prosperity. He died greatly honoured at 70 years of age, in 774, the twelfth year of Tai Tsung, the third emperor under whom he had served. The festival of feeding the hungry spirits 孟蘭勝會 is attributed to him. His titles of 智藏 and 不空三藏 are Thesaurus of Wisdom and Amogha Tripitaka.	[Soothill]

Its many benefits include the attainment of the samādhi of confusion-free knowledge (asaṃmohajn~ānavyūha 不空如智), generation of merit, and the purification of bad karma manifesting as physical illness; furthermore, a reciter who fasts on a certain day in reverence for the dhāraṇī gains twenty boons (anuśamṣa 功德) and eight dharmas. Then Avalokiteśvara gives the full dhāraṇī, and concludes with instructions for medical, salvific and iconographic rituals related to its use.

Amoghavajra (705-774). A prolific translator who became one of the most politically powerful Buddhist monks in Chinese history, acknowledged as one of the eight patriarchs of the doctrine 傅授八祖 in Shingon lineages. Born in Samarkand of a Indian father and Sogdian mother, he went to China at age 10 after his father's death. In 719, he was ordained into the sangha by Vajrabodhi 金剛智 and became his disciple. After all foreign monks were expelled from China in 741, he and some associates went on a pilgrimage to gather texts, visiting Sri Lanka, Southeast Asia and India. During this voyage, he apparently met Nagabodhi 龍智, master of Vajrabodhi, and studied the Tattvasaṃgraha 金剛頂經 system at length. He returned to China in 746 with some five hundred volumes. In 750, he left the court to join the military governorship of Geshu Han 哥舒翰, for whom he conducted large-scale tantric initations 灌頂 at field headquarters. In 754, he translated the first portion of the Tattvasaṃgraha (T 865), the central text of Buddhist esotericism, which became one of his most significant accomplishments. He regarded its teachings as the most effective method for attaining enlightenment yet devised, and incorporated its basic schema in a number of writings. Amoghavajra was captured in general An Lushan's 安祿山 rebellion but in 757 was freed by loyalist forces, whereupon he performed rites to purify the capital and consolidate the security of the Tang state. Two years later, he initiated the emperor Suzong 肅宗 as a cakravartin 轉輪王. In 765, Amoghavajra used his new rendition of the 'Scripture of Humane Kings' 仁王經 (T 246) in an elaborate ritual to counter the advance of a 200,000-strong army of Tibetans and Uighurs which was poised to invade Zhangan 長安. Its leader, Pugu Huaien 僕固懷恩, dropped dead in camp and his forces dispersed. The opulent Jingao temple 金閣寺 on Mount Wutai was completed in 767, a pet project of Amoghavajra's, and one of his many efforts to promote the bodhisattva Man~juśrī 文殊菩薩 as the protector of China. Amoghavajra continued to perform rites to avert disaster at the request of the emperor Taizong 太宗. On his death in 774, three days of morning were officially declared, and he posthumously received various exalted titles. The Chinese monks Huiguo 惠果 and Huilin 慧琳 were among his most prominent successors. Seventy-seven texts were translated by Amoghavajra according to his own account, though many more, including original compositions, are ascribed to him in the Chinese canons. The following documents relate to his life and work: (T 2120) contains records of his personal correspondence, (T 2156) records lineages, there is a biography in the Fu facang yinyuan fu 付法藏因緣傅 (T 2058), and an account of his travels is given in (T 2157).

Mādhyamika, one of the major streams of Indian Mahāyāna Buddhism which was to have a profound impact on all subsequent forms of Buddhism which arose in East Asia and Tibet. Based chiefly in the "middle way" 中論 philosophy of Nāgārjuna 龍樹, the Mādhyamika thinkers sought to investigate a middle ground between the two extremes of existence 有 or non-existence 無 of things. Seen through the logic of dependent co-arising 緣起, all things were seen to be lacking of inherent nature 自性--to be empty 空. The most important successor to Nāgārjuna in the development of this school was āryadeva 聖提婆 (170-270, also commonly written 提婆) who helped to complete the framework of the Mādhyamika system in his Catuh-śataka 四百論, etc. He was followed a few centuries later by such figures as Buddhapālita (佛護, c.470-540), Bhāvaviveka (清辯, c. 490-570) and Candrakīrti (月稱, c. 650), who worked out, each in their own ways various types of proofs for the explanation of and apprehension of the nature of emptiness. Some of the most important basic antagonistic positions within the broad Mādhyamika tradition can be seen in the disagreement between Bhāvaviveka and Candrakīrti: while Bhāvaviveka used one form of logical argumentation to establish the truth of emptiness in a positive manner, Candrakīrti denied the validity of the use of logical propositions which ended up affirming any sort of positive position. This basic disagreement would become embedded within the Mādhyamika school to the extent that two distinct philosophical factions developed: the Svātrantika (Dulilunzhengpai 獨立論證派), which basically followed the position of Bhāvaviveka and the Prāsaṇgika (Guimiulunzhengpai 歸謬論證派), which supported the opinion of Buddhapālita and Candrakīrti. Some later (eighth century) Mādhyamika thinkers such as Śāntarakṣita 寂護 and Kamalaśīla 蓮華戒 blended the Mādhyamika theories together with that of the Yogācāra movement, which had risen in popularity during the fifth century. The Three-treatise school 三論宗 which arose in East Asia was based primarily in the basic positions of the school's earliest thinkers, Nāgārjuna and āryadeva.	[EngBuddhist]

中觀論 Prāñnyāya-mūla-śāstra-ṭīkā, or Prāṇyamula-śāstra-ṭīkā; the Mādhyamika-śāstra, attributed to the bodhisattvas Nāgārjuna as creator, and Nīlacakṣus as compiler; tr. by Kumārajīva A. D. 409. It is the principal work of the Mādhyamika, or Middle School, attributed to Nāgārjuna. Versions only exist in Chinese and Tibetan; an English translation by Miyamoto exists and publication is promised; a German version is by Walleser. The 中論 is the first and most?? important of the 三論 q. v. The teaching of this School is found additionally in the 順中論; 般若燈論釋大乘中觀釋論 and 中論疏. Cf. 中道. The doctrine opposes the rigid categories of existence and non-existence 假 and 空, and denies the two extremes of production (or creation) and nonproduction and other antitheses, in the interests of a middle or superior way.	[Soothill]

Kumārajīva 鳩摩羅什 translated it in 409, adding his own comments. This is the basic text for the study of Mādhyamika 中觀派 thought.

The 'mean' has various interpretations. In general it denotes the mean between two extremes, and has special reference to the mean between realism and nihilism, or eternal substantial existence and annihilation; this 'mean' is found in a third principle between the two, suggesting the idea of a realm of mind or spirit beyond the terminology of 有 or 無, substance or nothing, or, that which has form, and is therefore measurable and ponderable, and its opposite of total non-existence. See 中論. The following four Schools define the term according to their several scriptures: the 法相 School describes it as the 唯識, v. 唯識中道; the 三論 School as the 八不 eight negations, v. 三論; the Tiantai as 實相 the true reality; and the Huayan as the 法界 dharmadhātu. Four forms of the Mean are given by the 三論玄義.	[Soothill]

(1) The 'middle way,' a common term for the Buddhist path. In the earlier Pali literature it refers to a path that avoids the extremes of asceticism and self-satisfaction. (2) Later, during the development of Mahāyāna Buddhism, especially as taught by Nāgārjuna 龍樹 and others, it refers to the cultivation of the enlightened mindfulness which is not trapped in the extremes of nihīism or eternalism, or being and non-being. Also used as an informal term to refer to the Mādhyamika 中觀派 school, which was founded by Nāgārjuna.(3) During the latter Silla in Korea, a school named Chungdo arose from somewhat uncertain origins, but which was not associated with the Sanlun school.	[EngBuddhist]
The doctrine of the 'mean', is the dharmadhātu, or 'spiritual ' universe.	[Soothill]

The special focus of this text is on the Yogācāra articulation of the meaning of mistaken discrimination 虛妄分別 vs. the meaning of emptiness of inherent nature 空性, with the aim of breaking attachment to extreme notions of emptiness 有 and existence 無. There are two Chinese translations: (1) Three fascicle translation by Xuanzang (T 1600.31.464-477). (2) Two fascicle translation by Paramārtha 真諦 (T 1599.31.451a-463)	[EngBuddhist]

The phenomenal hindrances are those of the human passions of like and dislike, and all other related addictive or painful emotions which keep sentient beings bound in the cycle of life and death. Therefore, these hindrances are analogous to the "hindrances of affliction" (fannaozhang 煩惱障) of the school of Consciousness-only.

[Soothill]

The "two vehicles" of śrāvaka 聲聞 and pratyekabuddha 闢支佛. These two practitioners are regularly introduce in Mahāyāna literature where they are cast in a negative light as representatives of the so-called "hīnayāna" 小乘 tradition, where they are set up in contradistinction to the bodhisattva 菩薩. They are understood as practitioners who are engaged in a view toward practice and enlightenment which will permit them to reach the level of arhatship 阿羅漢 and not Buddhahood. This means that they are able to permanently sever the multitude of afflictions engendered by the three poisons 三毒. But they are unable to progress further along the path in the manner of the bodhisattva due to a lack in the development of their compassion 慈悲 for other beings as well as a limitation in their understanding of the emptiness 空 of all phenomena 法. One of the first Mahāyāna scriptures to make detailed distinctions between the practitioners of the two vehicles and the bodhisattvas was the Śrīmālā-sūtra 勝鬘經.	[EngBuddhist]

HPC 1.789-814. This treatise examines and compares the various explications regarding the two hindrances as found in the major Yogācāra texts, most prominent of which are the Yogācārabhūmi-śāstra 瑜伽論, Saṃdhinirmocana-sūtra 解深密經, Mahāyānābhidharma-samuccaya-vyākhyā 對法論, Śrīmālādevī-simhanāda-sūtra 勝鬘經 and Prakaranāryavāca-śāstra 顯揚論.

He then explains how they are to be removed in terms of the various Yogācāra path scenarios, how their removal is handled by different classes of practitioners, and so forth. It is one of the most instructive works available for understanding the Buddhist notions of defilment/affliction and the obstructions to enlightenment created by the discriminating human mind.

A few of these are as follows:##(A) That propounded by Zigui 自軌 consists of these five: (1) the teaching of causal arising (Sarvāstivādin, etc.); (2) the teaching of provisional names (Chengshi lun, etc.); (3) the teaching of the negation of reality (Prajn~āpāramitā sutras); (4) the teaching of reality (Nirvāna Sutra); (5) the teaching of the Reality-realm (Avataṃsaka Sūtra).##(B) The classification done by Huikuan 慧觀 and Fayan 法雲 of (1) the teaching of the existence of form (āgama s); (2) the teaching of the non-existence of form (Prajn~āpāramitā sutras); (3) Restraining and praising teaching (Vimalakīrti Sutra etc.) 維摩經; (4) the Teaching of Same Meaning (Lotus Sutra) 法華經 and (5) the Eternal Teaching (Nirvāna Sutra) 涅槃經.##(C) The Huayan scheme, as taught by Fazang 法藏, consists of the following five: (1) xiaoshengjiao 小乘教 Hīnayāna teaching; (2) dashengshijiao 大乘始教 Elementary doctrine of Mahāyāna, which refers to Faxiang and Sanlun 三論 teachings; (3) dashengzhongjiao 大乘終教 the Final Doctrine of Mahāyāna, which asserts the existence of Buddha-nature in all beings; (4) dashengdunjiao 大乘頓教 the Sudden Enlightenment doctrine of Mahāyāna and (5) dashengyuanjiao 大乘圓教 the perfect doctrine of Mahāyāna, namely Huayan teaching.

(五時教) The five periods or divisions of Śākyamuni's teaching. According to Tiantai they are (1) 華嚴時 the Avataṃsaka or first period in three divisions each of seven days, after his enlightenment, when he preached the content, of this sutra; (2) 鹿苑時 the twelve years of his preaching the Āgamas 阿含 in the Deer Park; (3) 方等時 the eight years of preaching Mahāyāna-cum-Hīnayāna doctrines, the vaipulya period; (4) 般若時 the twenty-two years of his preaching the prajñā or wisdom sutras; (5) 法華涅槃時 the eight years of his preaching the Lotus Sutra and, in a day and a night, the Nirvana Sutra. According to the Nirvana School (now part of the Tiantai) they are (1) 三乘別教 the period when the differentiated teaching began and the distinction of the three vehicles, as represented by the 四諦 Four Noble Truths for śrāvakas, the 十二因緣 Twelve Nidānas for pratyekabuddhas, and the 六度 Six Pāramitās for bodhisattvas; (2) 三乘通教 the teaching common to all three vehicles, as seen in the 般若經; (3) 抑揚教 the teaching of the 維摩經, the 思益梵天所問經, and other sutras olling the bodhisattva teaching at the expense of that for śrāvakas; (4) 同歸教 the common objective teaching calling all three vehicles, through the Lotus, to union in the one vehicle; (5) 常住教 the teaehmg of eternal life i. e. the revelation through the Nirvana sutra of the eternity of Buddhahood; these five are also called 有相; 無相; 抑揚; 曾三歸—; and 圓常. According to 劉虬 Liu Chiu of the 晉 Chin dynasty, the teaching is divided into 頓 immediate and 漸 gradual attainment, the latter having five divisions called 五時教 similar to those of the Tiantai group. According to 法寶 Fabao of the Tang dynasty the five are (1) 小乘; (2) 般着 or 大乘; (3) 深密 or 三乘; (4) 法華 or 一乘; (5) 涅槃 or 佛性教.	[Soothill]

'five teaching periods.' A division of the periods of the varying methods used by Śākyamuni to explain the dharma from the time he attained enlightenment until the time he entered nirvana. Though there are various theories regarding these five, all are generally derived from the original explanation propounded by Huikuan 慧觀 in the fifth century. (A) Huikuan's explanation divides the teaching into gradual 漸 and sudden 頓, further dividing sudden into the following five: (1) the Distinct Teaching of the Three Vehicles (āgama Sutras, etc.); (2) the Three Vehicle Shared Teaching (Prajn~āpāramitā Sūtra s, etc.); (3) the Restraining and Praising Teaching (Vimalakīrti Sutra 維摩經, etc.); (4) the Teaching of the Shared Intent (Avataṃsaka-sūtra 華嚴經, etc.) and (5) the Eternal Teaching (Nirvāna-sūtra 涅槃經, etc.). This is the classification of the "Nirvāna school." (B) In the Huayan teaching of Liuqiu 劉 the Avataṃsaka-sūtra is called the "Sudden teaching" and the "gradual teaching" is divided into the following five: (1) The Teaching of Men and Gods; (2) The Teaching of the Existence of Form (the āgamas and so forth, that accept the existence of discriminated forms); (3) The Formless Teaching (prajn~āpāramitā teaching, etc., that denies the real existence of form); (4) The Teaching of Shared Intent (Lotus Sutra, etc.) and (5) The Eternal Teaching (Nirvāna Sutra etc.) (C) Zhiyi altered the above (B) somewhat. According to Tiantai 天台 teaching, the five periods are: (1) The Huayan period. After the Buddha's enlightenment, he expounded the Avataṃsaka-sūtra for 21 days for bodhisattvas. This was a teaching for those of very sharp faculties, and according to this teaching such bodhisattvas may directly awaken to the reality-principle. (2) The Deer Park period. After delivering the Avataṃsaka-sūtra, ordinary people of undeveloped faculties are not able to understand, so he discards this teaching in favor of guiding people through expedient teachings. Thus he delivered the lesser vehicle teachings at Deer Park near Benares. This period was twelve years, and the scriptures that developed from this are the āgamas, so it is also called the "āgama period." (3) The Vaipulya period (Elementary Mahāyāna). For the people that had grasped the Hīnayāna teachings, the Buddha now teaches Mahāyāna Sutras such as the Vimalakīrti Sutra, the Sūtra of the Golden Light and the Srimala Sūtra 勝鬘經, broadly explaining the Tripitaka, Shared, Distinct and Perfect Teachings. This is intended to convert people from Hīnayāna to Mahāyāna. This period lasts for eight years. (4) Perfection of Wisdom. For 22 years the Buddha teaches the Prajn~āpāramitā sutras in order to awaken people to the principle of emptiness. (5) The Lotus and Nirvāna period. The Buddha makes clear that the final goal of Hīnayāna and Mahāyāna is to same. Thus it is also called the Teaching of the Single Vehicle, wherein the presence of Buddha-nature in each person is affirmed.	[EngBuddhist]
A Tiantai classification of the Buddha's teaching into five periods and eight kinds of doctrine, which eight are subdivided into two groups of four each, 化儀四教 and 化法四教.	[Soothill]

A doctrinal classification system as explained by Zhiyi. The order in which Śākyamuni taught the dharma is broken down into five periods (see wu-chiao 五教). The methods which he used are also broken down into four types, and the contents of the teaching into four categories. (A) The four methods of teaching are: (1) the Sudden Teaching 頓教, which is the teaching of the direct awakening to the Buddha-nature; (2) the Gradual Teaching 漸教, where one is lead from shallow understanding to deep understanding; (3) the Secret Indeterminate Teaching, where the aspirants secretly receive teaching appropriate to their own abilities without being aware of the presence of others and (4) the Express Indeterminate Teaching, where the listeners, though aware of each other, still receive teaching according to their individual capacities. There is, in addition to this, the method of "neither sudden nor gradual, neither secret nor variable", also known as the "method of the Lotus and Nirvāna Sutras. (B) The four types of content are (1) Hīnayāna or "Tripitaka" teachings; (2) "Pervasive" or "Shared" 通 teachings. This is Mahāyāna teaching that includes the teaching of Vaipulya, Prajn~āpāramitā, Lotus and Nirvāna, and is for śrāvakas, pratyekabuddhas and bodhisattvas; (3) the Distinct Teaching. This is teaching for bodhisattvas only. The practitioners understanding has its emphasis on the middle truth of understanding emptiness and existence. Huayan teaching is typical of this type. (4) The Perfect Teaching. Enlightenment and delusion do not differ in essence. The teaching of the perfect mutual penetration and containment of all things, the explanation of the Buddha's enlightenment exactly as it is. The perfect teaching is actually contained in all the other teachings, but is most excellently put forth in the Lotus Sutra 法華經.	[EngBuddhist]

The five kinds of wisdom of the 真言宗 Shingon School. Of the six elements 六大 earth, water, fire, air (or wind), ether (or space) 曇空, and consciousness (or mind 識 ), the first five form the phenomenal world, or Garbhadhātu, the womb of all things 胎藏界, the sixth is the conscious, or perceptive, or wisdom world, the Vajradhātu 金剛界, sometimes called the Diamond realm. The two realms are not originally apart, but one, and there is no consciousness without the other five elements. The sixth element, vijñāna, is further subdivided into five called the 五智 Five Wisdoms: (1) 法界體性智 dharmadhātu-prakṛti-jñāna, derived from the amala-vijñāna, or pure 識; it is the wisdom of the embodied nature of the dharmadhātu, defined as the six elements, and is associated with Vairocana 大日, in the centre, who abides in this samādhi; it also corresponds to the ether 空 element. (2) 大圓鏡智 adarśana-jñāna, the great round mirror wisdom, derived from the ālaya-vijñāna, reflecting all things; corresponds to earth, and is associated with Akṣobhya and the east. (3) 平等性智 samatā-jñāna, derived from mano-vijñāna, wisdom in regard to all things equally and universally; corresponds to fire, and is associated with Ratnasaṃbhava and the south. (4) 妙觀察智 pratyavekṣaṇa-jñāna, derived from 意識, wisdom of profound insight, or discrimination, for exposition and doubt-destruction; corresponds to water, and is associated with Amitābha and the west. (5) 成所作智 kṛtyānuṣṭhāna-jñāna, derived from the five senses, the wisdom of perfecting the double work of self-welfare and the welfare of others; corresponds to air 風 and is associated with Amoghasiddhi and the north. These five Dhyāni-Buddhas are the 五智如來. The five kinds of wisdom are the four belonging to every Buddha, of the exoteric cult, to which the esoteric cult adds the first, pure, all-refecting, universal, all-discerning, and all-perfecting.

(3) Evil view 邪見 (mithyā-dṛṣṭi), wherein one does not properly acknowledge the relationship of cause and effect). (4) The view of attachment to views 見取見, i.e., holding rigidly to one opinion over all others. (dṛṣṭi-parāmarśa-dṛṣṭi). (5) The view of rigid attachment to the precepts 戒禁取見. The view that the austerities, moral practices and vows of non-Buddhist sects can lead one to the truth (śīla-vrata-parāmarśa-dṛṣṭi). This set of views without the last, are called the four views 四見.

The 本覺 is bodhi in the potential, 始覺 is bodhi in the active state, hence (2), (3), (4), and (5) are all the latter, but the fifth has reached the perfect quiescent stage of original bodhi.	[Soothill]

The five parijñānas, perceptions or cognitions; ordinarily those arising from the five senses, i. e. of form-and-color, sound, smell, taste, and touch. The 起信論 Awakening of Faith has a different set of five steps in the history of cognition; (1) 業識 initial functioning of mind under the influence of the original 無明 unenlightenment or state of ignorance; (2) 轉識 the act of turning towards the apparent object for its observation; (3) 現識 observation of the object as it appears; (4) 知識 the deductions derived from its appearance; (5) 相續識 the consequent feelings of like or dislike, pleasure or pain, from which arise the delusions and incarnations.	[Soothill]

The five consciousnesses produced in connection with the five sense organs of eyes, ears, nose, tongue and skin, which take as their objects the five physical categories of form, sound, smell, taste and tactile objects: therefore, the visual consciousness 眼識, auditory consciousness 耳識, olfactory consciousness 鼻識, gustatory consciousness 舌識 and tactile consciousness 身識. Since these are considered to be the first five among the six consciousnesses 六識, they are commonly referred to as the "prior five consciousnesses" in Chinese, 前五識. In the doctrine of the Yogācāra school, these are the first five among the eight consciousnesses 八識. In terms of the three realms , those in the desire realm are said to have six consciousnesses; those in the first meditation heaven of the form realm lack the olfactory and gustatory consciousnesses, while those in the second meditation heaven and above maintain only the sixth (discriminating) consciousness. (panca-vijn~āna)〔俱舍論〕 {II} The five consciousnesses taught in the Awakening of Faith: (1) The activity (karmic) consciousness 業識, which arises with the unenlightened mind due to original ignorance. (2) The changing (transforming) consciousness 轉識, wherein the activity consciousness undergoes a single transformation producing the subjective view. (3) The manifesting consciousness 現識, in which based on transformation of the activity consciousness the objective world is manifested.

ujong (1520-1604); a Choson dynasty Son monk who can be counted among the five most important figures in Korean Buddhist history; commonly known in Korea by the respectful title Sosan Taesa 西山大師. He was an influential teacher and writer, who is said to have guided hundreds of students, a number of whom turned into Son masters in their own right. He played a major role in consolidating the forms of study and practice of Korean Son which would, by and large, remain in place down to modern times. What has made Hyujong most respected in the broad view of Korean history was his role in the creation and guidance of an army of monks, which played a decisive role in the eventual repulsion of the Japanese invasion by the armies of Hideyoshi Toyotomi 秀吉禮臣.##In addition to serving in this unusual capacity of military leader, Sosan was a first-rate Son master and the author of a number of important religious texts, the most important of which is his Songa kwigam 禪家龜鑒, a guide to Son practice which is studied by Korean monks down to the present. Like most monks of the Choson period, he had been initially educated in Neo-Confucian philosophy. Dissatisfied, he wandered through the mountain monasteries, eventually joining the sangha. Later, after making a name for himself as a teacher, he was made arbiter of the Son school by queen Munjong. He soon resigned from this responsibility, returning to the itinerant life, advancing his Son studies and teaching at monasteries all around Korea. He died at 85, leaving behind some 1000 disciples, 70 of whom were monks and nuns, and many of whom held a prominent role in the later transmission of Choson Buddhism.##Hyujong is also known for his efforts in the continuation of the project of the unification of Buddhist doctrinal study and practice. He is considered the central figure in the revival of Choson Buddhism, and most major streams of modern Korean Son trace their lineages back to him through one of his four main disciples: Yujong 惟政; Ongi 彥機, T'aenung 太能 and Ilson 一禪, all four of whom were assistants to Sosan during the war with Japan.

Buddha, from budh to "be aware of", "conceive", "observe", "wake"; also 佛陀; 浮圖; 浮陀; 浮頭; 浮塔; 勃陀; 勃馱; 沒馱; 母馱; 母陀; 部陀; 休屠. Buddha means "completely conscious, enlightened", and came to mean the enlightener. he Chinese translation is 覺 to perceive, aware, awake; and 智 gnosis, knowledge. There is an Eternal Buddha, see e.g. the Lotus Sutra, cap. 16, and multitudes of Buddhas, but the personality of a Supreme Buddha, an Ādi-Buddha, is not defined. Buddha is in and through all things, and some schools are definitely Pan-Buddhist in the pantheistic sense. In the triratna 三寶 commonly known as 三寶佛, while Śākyamuni Buddha is the first "person" of the Trinity, his Law the second, and the Order the third, all three by some are accounted as manifestations of the All-Buddha. As Śākyamuni, the title indicates him as the last of the line of Buddhas who have appeared in this world, Maitreya is to be the next. As such he is the one who has achieved enlightenment, having discovered the essential evil of existence (some say mundane existence, others all existence), and the way of deliverance from the constant round of reincarnations; this way is through the moral life into nirvana, by means of self-abnegation, the monastic life, and meditation. By this method a Buddha, or enlightened one, himself obtains Supreme Enlightenment, or Omniscience, and according to Māhāyanism leads all beings into the same enlightenment. He sees things not as they seem in their phenomenal but in their noumenal aspects, as they really are. The term is also applied to those who understand the chain of causality (twelve nidānas) and have attained enlightenment surpassing that of the arhat. Four types of the Buddha are referred to: (1) 三藏佛the Buddha of the Tripiṭaka who attained enlightenment on the bare ground under the bodhi-tree; (2) 通佛the Buddha on the deva robe under the bodhi-tree of the seven precious things; (3) 別佛the Buddha on the great precious Lotus throne under the Lotus realm bodhi-tree; and (4) 圓佛the Buddha on the throne of Space in the realm of eternal rest and glory where he is Vairocana. The Hīnayāna only admits the existence of one Buddha at a time; Mahāyāna claims the existence of many Buddhas at one and the same time, as many Buddhas as there are Buddha-universes, which are infinite in number.	[Soothill]

(1) The most basic meaning of the Sanskrit and Pali term buddha is that of "awakened," in the special sense of one who has awakened to the true nature of existence. In this sense, the meaning is often translated as "enlightened" 覺. (2) One who has completely extinguished all afflictive states of mind 煩惱 --who utterly lacks all the mixed manifestations of ignorance 無明, desire 貪, and dislike 嗔. (3) The historical Buddha, Śākyamuni, who lived in India during the 6th century BCE, who had a major enlightenment experience, who subsequently taught others the way to achieve libertion, and following whose death, the religious movement called Buddhism, was formed. (3) Any one of a number the Buddhas who are said to exist in the world. In the early Pali tradition, six are name, but in the later developing Mahāyāna tradition, Buddhas are understood to be infinite in number. In this sense, anyone who attains release (mokṣa 解脫, nirvāṇa 涅槃) from this world of recurring rebirths (saṃsāra 流轉) can be called, in the appropriate contexts, a Buddha. (4) Buddha as an eternal principle of enlightenment/reality, expressed in the notion of the dharmakāya 法身 of the Buddha. (5) Buddha as buddhahood 佛地, the final stage one attains as the result of practices.	[EngBuddhist]

In the schools where Mahāyāna adopted an Ādi-Buddha, these realms or Buddha-fields interpenetrated each other, since they were coexistent with the universe. There are two classes of Buddhakṣetra: (1) in the Vairocana Schools, regarded as the regions of progress for the righteous after death; (2) in the Amitābha Schools, regarded as the Pure Land; v.

While every one possesses the Buddha-nature, it requires to be cultivated in order to produce its ripe fruit.	[Soothill]

The buddha-nature. The possession by sentient beings of the innate buddha-mind, which is, prior to the full attainment of buddhahood, not fully actualized.

A synonym for tathāgatagarbha 如來藏.	[EngBuddhist]

The Foxing lun, Buddha-nature Treatise, written in four fascicles. T 1610.31.787a-813a. Attributed to Vasubandhu 世親, translated by Paramārtha 真諦. This treatise discusses the theory of the Buddha-nature in great detail in sixteen chapters, from the four aspects of: (1) dependent arising; (2) breaking attachment; (3) manifestation of essence; and (4) discriminated aspects. In the course of explaining how it is that all sentient beings have the buddha-nature, the mistaken views of non-Buddhists 外道 and lesser-vehicle practitioners 小乘 are refuted. The author cites extensively from the Śrīmālā-sūtra 勝鬘經, the Lotus Sutra 法華經 and the Yogācārabhūmi-śāstra 瑜伽師地論.	[EngBuddhist]

The Pulssi chappyon (Arguments Against the Buddhists), a late 14th century Korean Neo-Confucian polemical critique of Buddhism by Chong Tojon (鄭道傳 pen name: Sambong 三峰 1342-1398). In this work he carried out his most comprehensive refutation of Buddhism, singling out Buddhist doctrines and practices for detailed criticism. Chong stated that this book was written with the objective of refuting Buddhism once and for all "lest it destroy morality and eventually humanity itself." The charges leveled against Buddhism in the Pulsshi chappyon constitute a full inventory of the various arguments made by Confucians and Neo-Confucians from the time of the introduction of Buddhism into East Asia during the second century C.E. These arguments are arranged in eighteen sections, each of which is a critique on a particular aspect of Buddhist doctrine or practice.	[EngBuddhist]

Buddhapālita (ca.470-540) a major scholar of the Indian Mādhyamika school 中觀派. He was known for the the development of a negative dialectic in the proof of the concept of emptiness, which put his way of thinking at odds with such Mādhyamika masters as Bhāvaviveka (清辯, c. 490-570), but in agreement with later figures such as Candrakīrti (月稱, c. 650). Some of the most important basic antagonistic positions within the broad Mādhyamika tradition can be seen in the disagreement between Bhāvaviveka and Buddhapālita: while Bhāvaviveka used one form of logical argumentation to establish the truth of emptiness in a positive manner, Buddhapālita denied the validity of the use of logical propositions which ended up affirming any sort of positive position. The position taken by Buddhapālita and Candrakīrti would later end up in the creation of a distinct branch of Mādhyamika called Prāsaṇgika (guimiulunzhengpai 歸謬論證派).	[EngBuddhist]

buddhakāya, a general term for the trikāya, or threefold embodiment of Buddha. There are numerous categories or forms of the buddhakāya.	[Soothill]

(buddha-rūpa; buddha-kāya). The Buddha's (physical) body. As a result of the questions of Buddhist followers, inquiries were made resulting in "buddha-body theory." Śākyamuni himself established the position of believing in the true principle (dharma): that he himself would die but the dharma was indestructible and therefore said that after his death the dharma was to be depended upon. However, many disciples held to their concept of the Buddha's person and believed in it as the Buddha-dharma, and therefore, even while Śākyamuni was still in the world his body had come to be seen as transcendent. Because of this, after he died, the dharma that he had explained was regarded as indestructible, and was set up in contrast with his natural body, bringing about a 'two body' theory.	[EngBuddhist]
The way of Buddha, leading to Buddhahood; intp. as bodhi, enlightenment, gnosis.	[Soothill]

Literally, the "buddha-way," which means the path to the buddhahood, but also often refers the Buddha's enlightenment in itself; buddhahood. The terms seems to have developed in East Asia without a Sanskrit equivalent (although it can be equated with the Indian concept of bodhi), often used to indicate the enlightenment which is the original endowment of all sentient beings. See, for example T 842.17.913c (圓覺經).	[EngBuddhist]

(佛陀多羅多) Buddhatrāta of Kashmir or Kabul, was a translator about 650.	[Soothill]

Buddhatrāta, the name given in the colophon of the Sutra of Perfect Enlightenment 圓覺經 as its "translator." The facticity of this is questionable, since it seems fairly certain that the sutra was composed in China. Buddhatrāta's name also does not seem to be found in connection with any other texts.

(mārga-bhāvana) (2) The path of cultivation (bhāvanā-mārga), the fourth of the five stages 五位 of Abhidharma and Yogācāra practice, the second of the three sagely paths 三道. After the experience of the path of seeing 見道, the practitioner renews his efforts based on this new insight, seeking further accordance with reality. The afflictions that are eliminated in this path are those that are more deeply embedded, such as the innately arisen afflictions (俱生、思惑), whereas the prior path of seeing is able to eliminate the less deeply embedded afflictions (分別起、見惑). In the Abhidharmakośa, the entry into this stage is equivalent to that of stream winner 預流. 〔瑜伽論 T 1579.30.313b2〕	[EngBuddhist]

'Simultaneously produced hindrances,' or 'innate hindrances.' A term used by the Yogācāra school 瑜伽行派. Hindrances that arise simultaneously with the mind. In the attachment to self, there is attachment due to discriminating a self through thought. Yet even when purposely suppressing this kind of thought, there is a spontaneously arisen attachment to self. Even though one is trying not to give rise to such thought and trying to suppress the self-view, still an attachment to self arises. This is what is called "arising together with the mind." This arising occurs in the seventh consciousness as well as the sixth consciousness. The seeds produced by this hindrance are different from those produced by the 'discriminated arising' 分別障 hindrance. Since the discriminated arising hindrance is cut off when one awakens to the principle of dependent origination, they are cut off at one time during the Path of Seeing (jiandao 見道). However, the hindrance of simultaneous arising is habituated, so even if one understands the principle of the Way, the hindrance will still arise. Since the habituated nature has developed, one must repeatedly practice the contemplation of dependent origination in order to cut off this hindrance. 【參照: 俱生起】 Also written 俱生煩惱.	[EngBuddhist]

nhyo (617-686). One of the leading thinkers, writers and commentators of the Korean Buddhist tradition. With his life spanning the end of the Three Kingdoms period and the beginning of the Unified Silla, Wonhyo played a vital role in the reception and assimilation of the broad range of doctrinal Buddhist streams that flowed into the Korean peninsula at the time. Wonhyo was most interested in, and affected by Tathāgatagarbha 如來藏, Consciousness-only 唯識 and Hwaom 華嚴 thought. However, in his extensive scholarly works, addressed in commentaries and essays, he embraced the whole spectrum of the Buddhist teachings which were received in Korea, including such schools as Pure Land 淨土宗, Nirvana 涅槃宗, Sanlun 三論宗 and Tiantai 天台宗 (Lotus Sutra school). He wrote commentaries on virtually all of the most influential Mahāyāna scriptures, altogether including over eighty works in over two hundred fascicles. Among his most influential works were the commentaries he wrote on the Awakening of Faith 大乘起信論, Nirvana Sutra 涅槃經 and Vajrasamādhi Sutra 金剛三昧經. These were treated with utmost respect by leading Buddhist scholars in China and Japan, and served to help in placing the Awakening of Faith as the most influential text in the Korean tradition.##Wonhyo spent the earlier part of his career as a monk, but after a "consciousness-only" enlightenment experience, he left the priesthood and turned to the spreading of the buddhadharma as a layman. Because of this aspect of his character, Wonhyo ended up becoming a popular folk hero in Korea. He was a colleague and friend of the influential Silla Hwaom monk Uisang 義湘, and an important result of their combined works was the establishment of Hwaom as the dominant stream of doctrinal thought on the Korean peninsula. Wonhyo's 23 extant works are currently in the process of being translated into English as a joint project between Dongguk University and SUNY at Stony Brook.	[EngBuddhist]

The eight truths, postulates, or judgments of the 法相 Dharmalakṣana school, i.e. four common or mundane, and four of higher meaning. The first four are (1) common postulates on reality, considering the nominal as real, e.g. a pot; (2) common doctrinal postulates, e.g. the five skandhas; (3) abstract postulates, e.g. the four noble truths 四諦; and (4) temporal postulates in regard to the spiritual in the material. The second abstract or philosophical four are (5) postulates on constitution and function, e.g. of the skandhas; (6) on cause and effect, e.g. the 四諦; (7) on the void, the immaterial, or reality; and (8) on the pure inexpressible ultimate or absolute.	[Soothill]

The eight noble truths, also written as 八聖諦. {I} As taught in the Śrīmālā-sūtra, the number eight is attained on combining two kinds of interpretations of the Four Noble Truths, the so-called created four noble truths 有作四諦 and uncreated four noble truths 無作四諦. The former are understood as incomplete understandings of the four noble truths held by the practitioners of the two vehicles 二乘, and the latter are complete understandings possessed by bodhisattvas 菩薩. 〔勝鬘經法身品、仁王般若經疏卷三〕 {II} As taught in the Yogācārabhūmi-śāstra, (1) the truth of suffering of transience 行苦諦，wherein all conditioned existence arises and ceases without interruption. (2) the truth of suffering by destruction 壞苦諦，wherein one suffers by the disappearance of desirable objects. (3) the truth of everyday suffering 苦苦諦，wherein one meets disagreeable objects. (4) the truth of transmigration 流轉諦，or fragmentary saṃsāra 分段生死. (5) the truth of the cessation of transmigration 流息諦，or nirvana 涅槃. (6) the truth of defilement 雜染諦，or affliction 煩惱. (7) the truth of purity 清淨諦，where one eliminates afflictions upon ascertaining their unconditioned nature. (8) the truth of correct expedient means 正方便諦. 〔瑜伽師地論卷四十六、大乘法苑義林章卷二末〕	[EngBuddhist]
The eight parijñāna, or kinds of cognition, perception, or consciousness. They are the five senses of cakṣur-vijñāna, śrotra-v., ghrāna-v., jihvā-v., and kāya-v., i.e. seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, and touch. The sixth is mano-vijñāna, the mental sense, or intellect, v. 末那. It is defined as 意 mentality, apprehension, or by some as will. The seventh is styled kliṣṭa-mano-vijñāna 末那識 discriminated from the last as 思量 pondering, calculating; it is the discriminating and constructive sense, more than the intellectually perceptive; as infected by the ālaya-vijñāna., or receiving "seeds" from it, it is considered as the cause of all egoism and individualizing, i.e. of men and things, therefore of all illusion arising from assuming the seeming as the real. The eighth is the ālaya-vijñāna, 阿頼耶識 which is the storehouse, or basis from which come all "seeds"of consciousness. The seventh is also defined as the ādāna 阿陀那識 or "laying hold of" or "holding on to" consciousness.	[Soothill]

The eight consciousnesses (aṣṭa-vijn~ānāni), the articulation of which forms one of the most seminal and distinctive aspects of the doctrine of the Yogācāra 瑜伽行派 school of Buddhism, known in East Asia as Dharma-character 法相 school and Consciousness-only 唯識 school. According to this doctrine, sentient beings possess eight distinct layers of consciousness, the first five 五識 corresponding the sense perceptions, the sixth 意識 to the thinking mind, the seventh 末那識 to the notion of ego, and the eighth 阿賴耶識 as repository of all the impressions from one's experiences. As the first seven of these arise based on the eighth, they are called the transformed consciousnesses 轉識. In contrast, the eighth is known as the base consciousness 本識, store consciousness 藏識, or seed consciousness 種子識. 〔成唯識論 T 1585.31.〕	[EngBuddhist]

At eighteen he left home to meet a master named Enshō 圓照, at Kaidan-in 戒檀院 (a section of Tōdaiji 東大寺) and received the precepts at age 20. He learned the precepts from the monks Shōgen 證玄 and Jōin 淨因, received the esoteric teachings from Shōshu 聖守. Although he was a Kegon 華嚴 monk, he also studied Consciousness-only 唯識, Sanlun 三論, Pure Land 淨土, Zen, Confucianism, Taoism and the philosophers of the (Chinese) warring states period. In 1276 he lectured on the Huayan jing in the great Buddha hall of Tōdaiji 東大寺. After the death of Enshō, he carried on for him, and based in Kaidan-in, unceasingly lectured on the Kegon sutras and explained the rules of the Vinaya 戒律. In 1313 Gyōnen moved to Tōshōdaiji (also in Nara), staying there for five years before returning to Kaidan-in. Besides lecturing, he wrote extensively on Kegon, Tendai, Shingon, Sanron, Hossō, Kusha, Jōjitsu, Ritsu and Jōdo doctrine, as well as studies in history, Shintō and music. Altogether he wrote over 1200 volumes. He died at Kaidan-in at the age of 82. Some of his more famous works include An Outline of Eight Schools (八宗綱要), A Record of the Transmission of the Buddha-dharma through Three Countries (三國佛法傳通緣起), and the Essay on the Origins of Pure Land (淨土源流章).

Anantamukhanirhāra-dhāraṇī, Anantamukhasādhaka-nāma-dhāraṇī. Said to be redacted by the historical Buddha at Vaiśālī three months before his parinirvāṇa 大涅槃. Those who recite the dhāraṇī 陀羅尼 may overcome all hindrances and be remembered by the buddhas; those who realize its meaning rapidly gain bodhi, for its practice relies on non-perception of things (anupalaṃbha 無所得). In order for the dhāraṇī to be effective, the practitioner should renounce the world, live a virtuous life and understand the significance of the eight seed syllables (akṣarabīja 種字: pa, la, ba, ja, ka, dha, śa, kṣa). The presence of such practices in this relatively early text indicates its strong influence on the development of Buddhist esotericism.

He came to Loyang in the Northern Wei in 508, where he worked together with Bodhiruci 菩提流支 in the translation of the Daśabhūmika-śāstra 十地經論. Apparently he had significant disagreements with Bodhiruci in the process of the translation work, and left to work on other projects,1 being listed as a collaborator in the translation of a dozen or so other works. His chief disciple was Huiguang 慧光, who founded the southern branch of the Dilun school 地論宗.##(1) Lusthaus comments: "The tradition has not been as clear as we'd like about what exactly the difference was that sparked the disagreement between Bodhiruci (himself a good Yogacarin) and Ratnamati, and the so-called Dilun controversies of the 6th century obscure rather than illuminate them. The issue may have been -- already then -- Ratnamati's tendency to read in tathāgatagarbha ideas. Not that Bodhiruci would have been averse to tathāgatagarbha per se, but he wanted to render the texts in a manner true to the meaning as he understood it, in an orthodox Yogacarin sense (though the Dilun is not exactly a blatantly Yogacara text), and resented Ratnamati's intrusions."##Vaiśeṣika-daśapadārtha śāstra; (Treatise on the Ten Padārthas), by Maticandra 慧月, 1 fascicle, T 2138.54.1262-1266.

The ten stages are (1) 發心住 the purposive stage, the mind set upon Buddhahood; (2) 治地住 clear understanding and mental control; (3) 修行住 unhampered liberty in every direction; (4) 生貴住 acquiring the Tathāgata nature or seed; (5) 方便具足住 perfect adaptability and resemblance in self-development and development of others; (6) 正心住 the whole mind becoming Buddha-like; (7) 不退住 no retrogression, perfect unity and constant progress; (8) 童真住 as a Buddha-son now complete; (9) 法王子住 as prince of the law; (10) 灌頂住 baptism as such, e.g. the consecration of kings. Another interpretation of the above is: (1) spiritual resolve, stage of śrota-āpanna; (2) submission to rule, preparation for Sakṛdāgāmin stage;　(3) cultivation of virtue, attainment of Sakṛdāgāmin stage; (4) noble birth, preparation for the anāgāmin stage; (5) perfect means, attainment of anāgāmin stage; (6) right mind, preparation for arhatship; (7) no-retrogradation, the attainment of arhatship; (8) immortal youth, pratyekabuddhahood; (9) son of the law-king, the conception of bodhisattvahood; (10) baptism as the summit of attainment, the conception of Buddhahood.

'Ten buddhas.' In the Huayan kongmu zhang 華嚴孔目章, there are two kinds of ten Buddhas. The first ten are the ten buddhas of the realm of understanding. The bodhisattva, relying on the true wisdom of awakening, perceives that the dharma realm is all Buddha in ten aspects (bodies). These are the body of sentient beings, the body of lands, the karma reward body, the body of Buddhist disciples (arhats), the pratyekabuddha body, the bodhisattva body, the body of completely enlightened ones (tathāgatas), the body of knowledge, the reality-body, and the body of space. The second group of ten are the buddhas of the realm of practice. These are the correct enlightenment Buddha, the desire-to-save-sentient- beings Buddha, the karma-reward Buddha, the holding-fast Buddha, the transformation Buddha, the dharma-realm Buddha, the mind Buddha, the samādhi Buddha, the original nature Buddha, and the Buddha who becomes what he wishes.

The Stage of Endeavor jingjinxin 精進心. 4. The Stage of Mental Stability dingxin 定心. 5. The Stage of the Wisdom of Understanding Emptiness huixin 慧心. 6. The Stage of Pure Self-restraint jiexin 戒心. 7.

To draw up to, or near; approach; forthwith; to be; i.e. alias; if, even if; 就是. It is intp. as 和融 united together; 不二not two, i.e. identical; 不離 not separate, inseparable. It resembles implication, e.g. the afflictions or passions imply, or are, bodhi; births-and-deaths imply, or are, nirvana; the indication being that the one is contained in or leads to the other. Tiantai has three definitions: (1) The union, or unity, of two things, e.g. 煩惱 and 菩提, i.e. the passions and enlightenment, the former being taken as the 相 form, the latter 性 spirit, which two are inseparable; in other words, apart from the subjugation of the passions there is no enlightenment.

(1) To become one. As it is; just, exactly. Not two, not separate. Two things being different aspects of one thing, thus being inseparable. (2) Immediately, directly, now, then, accordingly.

(3) In Tiantai teaching there are three types of 即. The first is the non-separateness in the unity of two things; two things being a unity (erwuxianghe 二物相合). The second is called beimianxiangfan 背面相翻 or the "relationship between front and back by turning over." This refers to something like a coin, which has the separate aspects of "heads" and "tails," depending upon each perspective, but the coin is originally one thing. The third expression of singularity is called dangtiquanshi 當體全是, the "essence is identical," which is exemplified by the fact that astringent persimmons and sweet persimmons are in essence, the same fruit; A, as it is, is B. This ideograph can also mean "absolutely the same," a usage which originally began in Tiantai writings. (4) Supposing, even if.	[EngBuddhist]

itta-mātra). "Consciousness-only (vijn~apti-mātratā)." The theory that all existence is nothing but consciousness, and therefore there is nothing that lies outside of the mind. Consciousness-only was a major component of the thought of the school of Yogācāra 瑜伽行派. The Vijn~ānavādins explained the regularity and coherence of sense impressions as due to an underlying store of perceptions (ālaya-vijn~āna) 阿賴耶識 evolving from the accumulation of traces of earlier sense perceptions. These are active, and produce impressions 種子 similar to themselves, according to a regular pattern, as seeds produce plants. Each being possesses a store of perceptions and beings which are generically alike will produce similar perceptions from their stores at the same time. Its doctrine reduces all existence to one hundred elements (法 dharmas) into five divisions, namely, mind, mental function, material, not concomitant with mind and unconditioned, dharmas. According to this school, the external world is created when the ālaya (storehouse) consciousness is influenced ('perfumated') 薰 by "seeds" or effects of good and evil deeds. Another important contribution of the Consciousness-only thinkers was that of the three natures of imaginary, provisional and real. 【參照: 三性】##The major framework of Consciousness-only theory was developed by Maitreya 彌勒 and the two brothers Vasubandhu 世親 and Asaṅga 無著 in such treatises as the Abdhidharma-kośa-bhāsya 俱舍論, the Triṃśikā Vijn~aptimātratāsiddhiḥ (Thirty Verses on Consciousness-only) 唯識三十頌, Mahāyāna-saṃgraha 攝大乘論, and the Yogācārabhūmi-śāstra 瑜伽師地論. Consciousness-only doctrine was also defined in sutras such as the Saṃdhinirmocana-sūtra and Śrīmālā-sūtra 勝鬘經. The Mahāyāna-saṃgraha, for example, says "All conscious objects are only constructs of consciousness because there are no external objects. They are like a dream" (如此眾識唯識 以無塵等故 譬如夢等) 〔攝大乘論 T 1593.31.118b12〕(Keenan 1992: 40).	[EngBuddhist]
The Weishi sanshi lun; Triṃsikā (Thirty Verses on Vijn~apti-mātra Treatise) Vasubandhu 世親1586 Translated by Xuanzang 玄奘 in 648 at Hongfu Monastery. This is the root text on which the Cheng weishi lun 成唯識論 expounds. The Chinese title would literally translate into Sanskrit as Triṃsikā-vijn~apti-mātra śāstra. This is a basic work for East Asian Yogācāra, as it articulates the most basic doctrines such as the production of conditioned phenomena 有為法 from the ālayavijn~āna 阿賴耶識, and teaches how illusion is eliminated in the attainment of enlightenment. Translated in Lusthaus (2000). Other translations, from Sanskrit, found in Anacker (1984) and Kochumuttom (1982).	[EngBuddhist]
Wei-shih san-shih lun sung; the Triṃśikā Vijn~aptimātratāsiddhiḥ (Thirty Verses on Consciousness-only; 1 fasc., by Vasubandhu 世親, trans. Xuanzang 玄奘. A representative work by Vasubandhu which is one of the most important texts for the establishment of Yogācāra doctrine, wherein the most important principles heretofore explained by Maitreya 彌勒 and Asaṅga 無著 are skillfully and economically re-explained from the standpoint of the transformation of consciousness (識轉變, vijn~āna-parin~āma) in a short thirty verses. Since Vasubandhu passed away without having ever written explanatory commentary on these verses, succeeding generations of scholars engaged in extensive debate over their interpretation, to the extent that various schools of Yogācāra developed. Among these interpretations, it was that by Dharmapāla 護法 which came to be taken as orthodox. This commentary by Dharmapāla formed the major content of the Vijn~aptimātratāsiddhi-śāstra, which was translated into Chinese by Xuanzang 玄奘 as the Cheng weishi lun 成唯識論, in turn an important text in the formation of the Chinese Faxiang school 法相宗.

There are also translations by Prajn~āruci (唯識論) and Paramārtha (大乘唯識論). This was one of Vasubandhu's most philosophically important Yogācāra works, which refutes the realism of the non-Buddhist and pre-Mahāyāna schools.

Same as 唯識宗.	[Soothill]
The Consciousness-only school of thought, which took as its major tenet the concept that the experienced world is nothing other than the manifestation of our own consciousness. This basic view of the world formed the cornerstone of the doctrines of the Yogācāra school 瑜伽行派 in India as well as the "Dharma-characteristic" sects 法相宗 of East Asia, and therefore the term "School of Consciousness-only" is regularly used to refer to either one of these sects. The Yogācāra 瑜伽行派 school of Indian Buddhism, which together with the Middle Way (Mādhyamika; 中觀派) school, represented one of the two main branches of Mahāyāna philosophy. Its great teachers in India were Asaṅga (fourth century CE) 無著?無著 and his brother Vasubandhu 世親. When Asaṅga's works were first translated into Chinese in the sixth century CE, the school was known as Shelun 攝論宗, but eventually it was absorbed into the school of the great Chinese translator-monk Hsuan-tsang 玄奘 (596-664). Hsuan-tsang's school was known as the Fa-hsiang ('dharma-characteristic') school, after this main feature of its teachings.	[EngBuddhist]

They are (1) 見一切住地 the delusions arising from seeing things as they seem, not as they really are. (2) 欲愛住地 the desires in the desire-realm. (3) 色愛住地 the desires in the form-realm. (4) 有愛住地 the desires in the formless realm. When 無明住地 the state of ignorance is added we have the 五住地 five states. These five states condition all error, and are the ground in which spring the roots of the countless passions and delusions of all mortal beings.	[Soothill]

Four positions; four kinds of affliction: (1) jianyiqiezhudi 見一切住地 mistaken view in regard to all things in the three realms. (2) yuaizhuchi 欲愛住持 attachment to objects in the desire realm.

(1) 行四依 The four of ascetic practitioners— rag clothing; begging for food; sitting under trees; purgatives and diuretics as moral and spiritual means; these are also termed 四聖種. (2) 法四依 The four of the dharma: i. e. the truth, which is eternal, rather than man, even its propagator; the sutras of perfect meaning i. e. of the 道實相 the truth of the 'middle' way; the meaning, or spirit, not the letter; wisdom 智, i.e. Buddha-wisdom rather than mere knowledge 識. There are other groups. Cf. 四事.	[Soothill]

The "four reliances" (1) Four kinds of bodhisattvas. Four great teachers who instruct sentient beings after the passing away of the Buddha. In the Nirvana Sutra 涅槃經, the messenger of the Tathāgata, spreading the teaching of the end of the age, established the four kinds of bodhisattvas which people would depend upon, according to the four kinds of people. Depending upon which treatise one reads, the stages of the bodhisattva are divided up among these four in various ways. See the ninth chapter in the Nirvana Sutra entitled 四依品. (2) The four necessities of food, clothing, shelter and medicine.	[EngBuddhist]

There are two groups: (1) the common belief in the four above, denied by the early Buddhist doctrine that all is impermanent, suffering, impersonal, and impure; (2) the false belief of the Hīnayāna school that nirvana is not a state of permanence, joy, personality, and purity. Hīnayāna refutes the common view in regard to the phenomenal life; bodhisattvism refutes both views.	[Soothill]

The 法相 Dharmalakṣana school divides the function of 識 cognition into four, i. e. 相分 mental phenomena, 見分 discriminating such phenomena, 自證分 the power that discriminates, and 證自證 the proof or assurance of that power. Another group is: 信 faith, 解 liberty, 行 action, and 證 assurance or realization.	[Soothill]

They are xiangfen 相分 objective aspect, jianfen 見分 subjective aspect, zizhengfen 自證分 the aspect of the self perceiving the object and zhengzizhengfen 證自證分 the awareness of the function of being aware of the object. ("rewitnessing aspect"). This theory was first elucidated by Dharmapāla.	[EngBuddhist]

The four accesses in the stages of the śrāvaka path. 【參照: 四向四果】	[EngBuddhist]
The four accesses and four accomplishments (lit. "fruits") of the śrāvaka path (catvāri-phalani): (1) xutuo 須陀 "stream-enterer" (預流); (2) situojin 斯陀今 "once-returner" (一來); (3) anajin 阿那含 "non-returner" (不還, 不來); (4) aluohan 阿羅漢 "arhat" (無學). Each stage is seen as having two aspects: that of ascent into the stage, indicated by 向, and consummation of the stage, indicated by 果. The stream-enterer succeeds in eradicating conceptual disturbances 見惑 of the three realms (also called the eighty-eight defilements 八十八使), experiences the fifteen minds 十五心 of the Path of Seeing 見道, and finishing this task, enters the Path of Cultivation 修道, thus consummating this stage. Entering into the stage of once-returner, the practitioner removes the first six of the nine qualities 九品 of afflictions removable in the Path of Cultivation 修惑and thus consummates this stage. One then proceeds to enter the level of non-returner, where one eliminates the remaining three afflictions removable in the Path of Cultivation. In the final stage of arhat, all defilements have been permanently eradicated, and one is capable of entry into nirvana. 〔俱舍論、 T 1558.29.17b〕	[EngBuddhist]

catuṣ-kuśala-mūla, the four good roots, or sources from which spring good fruiy or development. In Hīnayāna they form the stage after 總相念住 as represented by the 俱舍 and 成實; in Mahāyāna it is the final stage of the 十迴向 as represented by the 法相宗. There are also four similar stages connected with śrāvaka, pratyekabuddha, and Buddha, styled 三品四善根. The four of the 俱舍宗 are 煗法, 頂法, 忍法, and 世第一法. The four of the 成實宗 are the same, but are applied differently. The 法相宗 retains the same four terms, but connects them with the four dhyāna stages of the 真唯識觀 in its four first 加行 developments.	[Soothill]

(mahā-bhūta). The 'four gross elements.' 'Gross' (大) means 'element,' which all substances are composed of. These are: (1) tu 土 the earth element (prthivī dhātu), which has the basic quality of hardness and the function of protection; (2) shui 水 water (ab-dhātu), which has the function of gathering and storing wetness; (3) 火 fire (teja-dhātu), which is the nature of heat and has the function of warming; (4) feng 風 wind (vāyū-dhātu), which has the function of giving life to all living things. It is thought that when these are gathered, material substance is produced; therefore they are called the 'forms of creatability.' In India, there are other transmissions of ideology whose explanations resemble this one, and even within Buddhism there are other explanations, but in the explanation of Abhidharma Buddhism, the objects of consciousness of earth, wind, fire and water are provisional elements, since the true elements are imperceptible.

e 'four thoughts' used by Vasubandhu in his commentary to the Diamond Sutra (T 1511.25.781c-782a) to outline Section Two of the Diamond Sutra,dividing it into four distinct passages (T 236.8.753a). The title of each of the Four Thoughts is extracted from a verse of Asaṅga's Ode to the Diamond Sutra (T1514), of which the Vasubandhu commentary is an annotation. This exegetical scheme used by Vasubandhu is usually found summarized in the Chinese exegetical texts. The Four Thoughts, and the passages they refer to are (using Bodhiruci's translation, T236/T1511):##1) The 'Broadly Extensive Thought' (廣大心). Corresponds to: "諸菩薩生如是心。所有一切眾生眾生所攝 ..." to .".. 所有眾生界眾生所攝。" (T236.8.753a1-4)##2) The 'Supreme Thought' (第一心). Corresponds to: "我皆令入無余涅槃而滅度之。" (T236.8.753a4-5)##3) The 'Eternal Thought' (常心). Corresponds to: "如是滅度無量無邊眾生實無眾生得滅度者。何以故。 須菩提。若菩薩有眾生相即非菩薩。" (T236.8.753a1-7) Vasubandhu comments that the living beings are not different from the bodhisattva's own self, and so if a bodhisattva conceives of the living beings as being separate from himself then he is not a bodhisattva. "Thusly apprehending the myriad beings as his own body, the eternal is not abandoned." (T1511.25.782a)##4) The 'Undeluded Thought' (不顛倒). Corresponds to: "何以故非。須菩提。若菩薩起眾生相人相壽者相。 則不名菩薩。" (T236.8.753a7-8) Vasubandhu comments: "This makes plain the distant separation (of the bodhisattva) from, and accordingly the cessation of, a self which views the images of myriad beings, etc." (T 1511.25.782a) It should be noted that one must use a translation of the Diamond Sutra other than Kumārajīva's to follow the fourfold division, as Kumārajīva does not include the final conclusion to this section of the sutra. The commentary by Vasubandhu was translated into Chinese by Bodhiruci 菩提流支 (T1511-金剛般若波羅蜜經論) and Yijing 義淨 (T1513-能斷金剛般若波羅蜜多經論釋), and those two versions of the Diamond Sutra are used in each respectively. Yijing also extracted Asaṅga's Ode from a separate text (T1514).	[EngBuddhist]

(四禪天) The four dhyāna heavens, 四靜慮 (四靜慮天), i. e. the division of the eighteen brahmalokas into four dhyānas: the disciple attains to one of these heavens according to the dhyāna he observes: (1) 初禪天 The first region, 'as large as one whole universe' comprises the three heavens, Brahma-pāriṣadya, Brahma-purohita, and Mahābrahma, 梵輔, 梵眾, and 大梵天; the inhabitants are without gustatory or olfactory organs, not needing food, but possess the other four of the six organs. (2) 二禪天 The second region, equal to 'a small chiliocosmos' 小千界, comprises the three heavens, according to Eitel, 'Parīttābha, Apramāṇābha, and Ābhāsvara, ' i. e. 少光 minor light, 無量光 infinite light, and 極光淨 utmost light purity; the inhabitants have ceased to require the five physical organs, possessing only the organ of mind. (3) 三禪天 The third region, equal to 'a middling chiliocosmos '中千界, comprises three heavens; Eitel gives them as Parīttaśubha, Apramāṇaśubha, and Śubhakṛtsna, i. e. 少淨 minor purity, 無量淨 infinite purity, and 偏淨 universal purity; the inhabitants still have the organ of mind and are receptive of great joy. (4) 四禪天 The fourth region, equal to a great chiliocosmos, 大千界, comprises the remaining nine brahmalokas, namely, Puṇyaprasava, Anabhraka, Bṛhatphala, Asañjñisattva, Avṛha, Atapa, Sudṛśa, Sudarśana, and Akaniṣṭha (Eitel). The Chinese titles are 福生 felicitous birth, 無雲 cloudless, 廣果 large fruitage, 無煩 no vexations, atapa is 無熱 no heat, sudṛśa is 善見 beautiful to see, sudarśana is 善現 beautiful appearing, two others are 色究竟 the end of form, and 無想天 the heaven above thought, but it is difficult to trace avṛha and akaniṣṭha; the inhabitants of this fourth region still have mind. The number of the dhyāna heavens differs; the Sarvāstivādins say 16, the 經 or Sutra school 17, and the Sthavirāḥ school 18. Eitel points out that the first dhyāna has one world with one moon, one mem, four continents, and six devalokas; the second dhyāna has 1, 000 times the worlds of the first; the third has 1, 000 times the worlds of the second; the fourth dhyāna has 1, 000 times those of the third. Within a kalpa of destruction 壞劫 the first is destroyed fifty-six times by fire, the second seven by water, the third once by wind, the fourth 'corresponding to a state of absolute indifference' remains 'untouched' by all the other evolutions; when 'fate (天命) comes to an end then the fourth dhyāna may come to an end too, but not sooner'.

The 'four meditation heavens' in the realm of form. The four spheres one is born into depending upon one's level of meditation practice in the four meditative concentrations 四禪. There are various sources which describe these, but one of the most extensive is the Abhidharmakośa-bhāsya 俱舍論, where they are discussed in connection with the term 四靜慮; the Zen gaku jiten cites a text called the Jietuodao lun 解脫道論. Those who practice the first meditative concentration in the present lifetime are born in the first meditation heaven into one of three different levels according to their proficiency in practice. Those of the lower level are born into heaven of Brahma followers 梵眾天; those of middling level are born into the heaven of Brahma's ministers 梵輔天 and those of the superior level are born into the great Brahma heaven 大梵天. In similar fashion, those who practice the second meditation in the present life are born into three grades of heavens according to their proficiency in practice: the heaven of limited light 少光天; the heaven of limitless light 無量光天 and the heaven of ultimate light and purity 極光淨天. In the third heaven there are again three: the heaven of limited purity 少淨天, the heaven of limitless purity 無量淨天 and the heaven of pervasive purity 遍淨天. The fourth heaven has eight levels: the first three of these, the cloudless heaven 無雲天 the heaven of blessed birth 福生天 and the heaven of extensive fruition 廣果天 are attainable by unenlightened sentient beings; the final five are attained only by Buddhist saints who have consummated the undefiled concentration of the fourth level: these are the heaven of no affliction 無煩天, the heaven of no heat 無熱天, the heaven of skillful manifestation 善現天, the heaven of skillful vision 善見天, and the heaven of ultimate form 色究竟天. 〔俱舍論、 T 1558.29.41a〕	[EngBuddhist]

'Four kinds of Nirvāna.' In the teachings of the Yogācāra school, nirvāna is divided into four types. The first is the nirvāna of the originally pure self-nature, the original thusness of all existence. The second refers to the thusness expressed in the extinction of the hindrances due to defilement, and is called "nirvāna with remainder." The third is "nirvāna without remainder"; in this nirvāna the hindrances due to defilement in the mind are cut off, and the body in which the five skandhas was united is extinguished. In the fourth, both the hindrances due to defilement and the hindrances of knowing are cut off, and a deep wisdom is attained wherein saṃsāra and nirvāna are not distinguished. Not abiding in nirvāna nor disliking saṃsāra, one teaches sentient beings yet does not become attached to the world. This condition of complete separation from delusion is called "nirvāna with no abode."	[EngBuddhist]

'four conditions', 'four causes.' {I} In the Consciousness-only 唯識 school, a broad division into four types, of the causes that produce all things. In this case, the ideograph yuan 緣 has the meaning of yin 因. This classification is used especially in explaining the "nature of dependent arising 依他起性." The explanation of the relationship of these four causes to the "six causes" 六因 differs between Consciousness-only and Abhidharma-kośa. The four are: (1) yinyuan 因緣 (hetu-pratyaya) a direct internal cause that produces a result. Refers to newly producing the fruit of a person--seeds and their manifestation. The production by the seeds in the ālaya Consciousness of the world cognized through the seven consciousnesses. (2) dengwujianyuan 等無間緣 (saṃanantara-pratyaya) Since the prior instant of mind/mental functioning gives rise directly to the succeeding instant of mind, there is no gap in their leading into one another. Also called cidiyuan 次第緣. (3) suoyuanyuan 所緣緣 'Object as condition' (ālambana-pratyaya). For the mind to arise, its object must be present, so every object becomes a cause for the mind. These objects are discriminated into the two types of 親 and 疏. (4) zengshangyuan 增上緣 (adhipati-pratyaya) 'Causes beyond direct empowerment.' This group includes all indirect causes outside the above three. Not only those things which give power to the production of results, but things which merely do not impede or hinder. {II} In the Sutra of Perfect Enlightenment 圓覺經, the Four Elements (四大). {III} In the Vajrasaṃādhi-sūtra, the four causes are: (1) 作擇滅力取緣; (2) 本利根淨所集起緣; (3) 本慧大悲力緣; (4) 一覺通智力緣.

catvāri-ārya-satyāni; 四聖諦; 四真諦. The four dogmas, or noble truths, the primary and fundamental doctrines of Śākyamuni, said to approximate to the form of medical diagnosis. They are pain or 'suffering, its cause, its ending, the way thereto; that existence is suffering, that human passion (taṇhā, 欲 desire) is the cause of continued suffering, that by the destruction of human passion existence may be brought to an end; that by a life of holiness the destruction of human passion may be attained'. Childers. The four are 苦, 聚 (or 集), 滅, and 道諦, i. e. duḥkha 豆佉, samudaya 三牟提耶, nirodha 尼棲陀, and mārga 末加. Eitel interprets them (1) 'that 'misery' is a necessary attribute of sentient existence'; (2) that 'the 'accumulation' of misery is caused by the passions'; (3) that 'the 'extinction' of passion is possible; (4) mārga is 'the doctrine of the 'path' that leads to the extinction of passion'. (1) 苦 suffering is the lot of the 六趣 six states of existence; (2) 集 is the aggregation (or exacerbation) of suffering by reason of the passions; (3) 滅 is nirvana, the extinction of desire and its consequences, and the leaving of the sufferings of mortality as void and extinct; (4) 道 is the way of such extinction, i. e. the 八正道 eightfold correct way. The first two are considered to be related to this life, the last two to 出世間 a life outside or apart from the world. The four are described as the fundamental doctrines first preached to his five former ascetic companions. Those who accepted these truths were in the stage of śrāvaka. There is much dispute as to the meaning of 滅 'extinction' as to whether it means extinction of suffering, of passion, or of existence. The Nirvana Sutra 18 says that whoever accepts the four dogmas will put an end to births and deaths 若能見四諦則得斷生死 which does not of necessity mean the termination of existence but that of continued transmigration. v. 滅.

v. 圓頓戒.	[Soothill]
The complete, perfect, or comprehensive doctrine; the school or sect of Mahāyāna which represents it. The term has had three references. The first was by 光統 Guangtong of the Later Wei, sixth century, who defined three schools, 漸 gradual, 頓 immediate, and 圓 inclusive or complete. The Tiantai called its fourth section the inclusive, complete, or perfect teaching 圓, the other three being 三藏 Hīnayāna, 通 Mahāyāna-cum-Hīnayāna, 別 Mahāyāna. The Huayan so called its fifth section, i.e. 小乘; 大乘始; 大乘終; 頓 and 圓. It is the Tiantai version that is in general acceptance, defined as a perfect whole and as complete in its parts; for the whole is the absolute and its parts are therefore the absolute; the two may be called noumenon and phenomenon, or 空 and 假 (or 俗), but in reality they are one, i.e. the 中 medial condition. To conceive these three as a whole is the Tiantai inclusive or 'perfect' doctrine. The Huayan 'perfect' doctrine also taught that unity and differentiation, or absolute and relative, were one, a similar doctrine to that of the identity of contraries. In Tiantai teaching the harmony is due to its underlying unity; its completeness to the permeation of this unity in all phenomena; these two are united in the medial 中 principle; to comprehend these three principles at one and the same time is the complete, all-containing, or 'perfect' doctrine of Tiantai. There are other definitions of the all-inclusive doctrine, e.g. the eight complete things, complete in teaching, principles, knowledge, etc. 圓教四門 v. 四門.	[Soothill]
The Tiantai doctrine of the complete cutting off, at one remove, of the three illusions, i.e. 見思 associated with 空; 塵沙 with 假; and 無明 with 中; q. v.	[Soothill]

(China) (2) (Korea) (3) (Japan) The head temple of the Engakuji branch of Japanese Rinzai, located in Kita-Kamakura, founded by Wuxue zuyuan 無學祖元 in 1282. One of the five Zen temples in Kamakura. In the ages of Bun-ei and Koan, Japan was attacked twice by Mongolia. It was the most unprecedented national crisis Japan ever met. Executive Tokimune Hojo, who had long embraced Zen, profoundly carried out his daily study of Zen even during the dangerous period of Koan. Wuxue zuyuan (Bukkō Kokushi佛光國師) was the Chan master from China whom the executive looked up to. The Japanese nation engaged the formidable enemy as a whole and beat back the Mongolians. After this, Tokimune wished not only to spread the way of Zen that remained his mental support all the while, but to hold a mass for the souls, of both Japanese and Mongolian soldiers who laid down their life in those wars. He also wanted to express his gratitude to his master Bukkō. Thus, the building of a temple was envisioned. The temple was given the name of engaku after Engaku-Kyo (Sutra of Perfect Enlightenment 圓覺經), dug out of the selected building site, in a stone chest.##          The establishment of Bukkō sect was succeeded from Kōhō Ken-nichi 高峰顯日 of Nasu Ungen-ji to Muso Soseki 夢窗疏石 of Tenryū-ji 天龍寺. Especially Muso was respected as 'the master of seven emperors' in the era of Northern and Southern Dynasties (1336-1392). His school formed the major influence of the Zen world of Japan in the Muromachi Era (1338-1573). The temple encountered fire several times. It also experienced temporary decline. However, Priest Seisetsu 誠拙 appeared at the end of the Edo Era (1603-1867) and reconstructed the monastery to consolidate the foundation of the present Engaku-ji. He maintained the austere atmosphere for trainees, carrying out the reform of the sect.##          In the Meiji Era (1868-1912), itinerant and laity trainees, called koji 居士, learned Zen under the direction of Imakita Kosen and his disciple Shaku Sōen 釋宗演. The temple became the center of Zen in the Kanto Area. From the zazen course for students at Kojirin, outstanding men of ability appeared in great numbers in its long proud history. Engaku-ji runs zazen circles of various kinds and summer courses open for the public. Engaku-ji has eighteen branch temples in its site in addition to Jōchi-ji 淨智寺, Tōkei-ｊi 東慶寺, and Zuisen-ji 瑞泉寺 nearby.	[EngBuddhist]

Earth-prison is generally intp. as hell or the hells; it may also be termed purgatory; one of the six gati or ways of transmigration. The hells are divided into three classes: I. Central, or radical, 根本地獄 consisting of (1) The eight hot hells. These were the original hells of primitive Buddhism, and are supposed to be located umder the southern continent Jambudvīpa 瞻部州, 500 yojanas below the surface. (a) 等活 or 更活 Saṃjīva, rebirth, where after many kinds of suffering a cold wind blows over the soul and returns it to this life as it was before, hence the name 等活. (b) 黑繩 Kaslasūtra, where the sufferer is bound with black chains and chopped or sawn asunder. (c) 線合; 眾合; 堆壓 Saṃghāta, where are multitudes of implements of torture, or the falling of mountains upon the sufferer. (d) 號呌; 呼呼; 叫喚 Raurava, hell of wailing.

(h) 無間; 河鼻旨; 阿惟越致; 阿毗至; 阿鼻; 阿毗 Avīci, unintermitted suffering, where sinners die and are reborn to suffer without interval. (2) The eight cold hells 八寒地獄. (a) 頞浮陀地獄 Arbuda, where the cold causes blisters. (b) 尼刺部陀 Nirarbuda, colder still causing the blisters to burst. (c) 頞哳吒; 阿吒吒 Atata, where this is the only possible sound from frozen lips. (d) 臛臛婆; 阿波波 Hahava or Apapa, where it is so cold that only this sound can be uttered. (e) 虎虎婆 Hāhādhara or Huhuva, where only this sound can be uttered. (f) 嗢缽羅; 鬱缽羅 (or 優缽羅) Utpala, or 尼羅鳥 (or 漚) 缽羅 Nīlotpala, where the skin is frozen like blue lotus buds. (g) 缽特摩 Padma, where the skin is frozen and bursts open like red lotus buds. (h) 摩訶缽特摩 Mahāpadma, ditto like great red lotus buds. Somewhat different names are also given. Cf. 俱舍論 8; 智度論 16; 涅槃經 11. II. The secondary hells are called 近邊地獄 adjacent hells or 十六遊增 each of its four sides, opening from each such door are four adjacent hells, in all sixteen; thus with the original eight there are 136. A list of eighteen hells is given in the 十八泥梨經. III. A third class is called the 孤地獄 (獨地獄) Lokāntarika, or isolated hells in mountains, deserts, below the earth and above it. Eitel says in regard to the eight hot hells that they range 'one beneath the other in tiers which begin at a depth of 11,900 yojanas and reach to a depth of 40,000 yojanas'. The cold hells are under 'the two Tchahavālas and range shaft-like one below the other, but so that this shaft is gradually widening to the fourth hell and then narrowing itself again so that the first and last hell have the shortest, those in the centre the longest diameter'. 'Every universe has the same number of hells, ' but 'the northern continent has no hell whatever, the two continents east and west of Meru have only small Lokāntarika hells... whilst all the other hells are required for the inhabitants of the southern continent '. It may be noted that the purpose of these hells is definitely punitive, as well as purgatorial. Yama is the judge and ruler, assisted by eighteen officers and a host of demons, who order or administer the various degrees of torture. 'His sister performs the same duties with regard to female criminals, ' and it may be mentioned that the Chinese have added the 血盆池 Lake of the bloody bath, or 'placenta tank' for women who die in childbirth. Release from the hells is in the power of the monks by tantric means.	[Soothill]

Translated into English as "hell" but literally refers to a prison in the bowels of the earth where it prisoners are subject to all kinds of torture as a result of their extensive evil activities in their prior life (such as violating the precepts 破戒). The original Indic terms of naraka and niraya (Sanskrit and Pali) are transliterated into Chinese as 奈落 (那落) and 泥黎 respectively. It is considered as one of the three evil destinies 三惡道 (三惡趣) five destinies 五趣, six destinies 六道, and ten realms 十界. The scriptures have extensive categories and lists of the hells, among the most well-known are the eight hot hells 八熱地獄 (八大地獄) and eight cold hells 八寒地獄 that extend between the saṃjīva 等活 and avīci 阿鼻 hells, which are all part of the primary hells 根本地獄. These also have secondary, or adjacent hells attached to them. A third class of hells are the "isolated" hells 孤地獄 in the mountains, deserts, below and above the earth. The composition of and relationship between the hells is explained in detail in such scriptures as the Abhidharmakośa-bhāsya 俱舍論. As one might expect, this extensive theory of hells developed over a long period of time, based on numerous sources and influences in Indian religion. All of the Buddhist dictionaries listed in the references for this entry contain extensive detail regarding the lists and attributes of the hells.	[EngBuddhist]

Ti-tsang, J. Jizō, Kṣitigarbha, 乞叉底蘗沙; Earth-store, Earth-treasury, or Earthwomb. One of the group of eight Dhvani- Bodhisattvas. With hints of a feminine origin, he is now the guardian of the earth. Though associated with Yama as overlord, and with the dead and the hells, his role is that of saviour. Depicted with the alarum staff with its six rings, he is accredited with power over the hells and is devoted to the saving of all creatures between the nirvana of Śākyamuni and the advent of Maitreya the fifth century he has been especially considered as the deliverer from the hells. His central place in China is at Chiu-hua-shan, forty li south-west of Ch'ing-yang in Anhui. In Japan he is also the protector of travellers by land and his image accordingly appears on the roads; bereaved parents put stones by his images to seek his aid in relieving the labours of their dead in the task of piling stones on the banks of the Buddhist Styx; he also helps women in labour. He is described as holding a place between the gods and men on the one hand and the hells on the other for saving all in distress; some say he is an incarnation of Yama. At dawn he sits immobile on the earth 地 and meditates on the myriads of its beings 藏. When represented as a monk, it may be through the influence of a Korean monk who is considered to be his incarnation, and who came to China in 653 and died in 728 at the age of 99 after residing at Chiu-hua-shan for seventy-five years: his body, not decaying, is said to have been gilded over and became an object of worship. Many have confused 真羅 part of Korea with 暹羅 Siam. There are other developments of Ti-tsang, such as the 六地藏 Six Ti-tsang, i. e. severally converting or transforming those in the hells, pretas, animals, asuras, men, and the devas; these six Ti-tsang have different images and symbols. Ti-tsang has also six messengers 六使者: Yama for transforming those in hell; the pearl-holder for pretas; the strong one or animals; the devīof mercy for asuras; the devī of the treasure for human beings; one who has charge of the heavens for the devas. There is also the 延命地藏 Yanming Ti-tsang, who controls length of days and who is approached, as also may be P'u-hsien, for that Purpose; his two assistants are the Supervisors of good and evil 掌善 and 掌惡. Under another form, as 勝軍地藏 Ti-tsang is chiefly associated with the esoteric cult. The benefits derived from his worship are many, some say ten, others say twenty-eight. His vows are contained in the 地藏菩薩本願經. There is also the 大乘大集地藏十電經 tr. by Xuanzang in 10 juan in the seventh century, which probably influenced the spread of the Ti-tsang cult.	[Soothill]

Dilun 【參照: 十地經論】	[EngBuddhist]
The Dilun zong: in English, the Stages Sect, or School of the Treatise on the Bhūmis. One of the earlier schools of Chinese Buddhism, which was based on the commentary written by Vasubandhu 世親 on the Daśabhūmika-śāstra (Shidijing lun 十地經論), which also forms the commentary on one chapter of the Huayan jing 華嚴經. Ratnamati 勒那摩提 and Bodhiruci 菩提流支 brought the manuscript of the Daśabhūmi-vyākhyāna and translated it into Chinese during the Northern Wei dynasty. The Dilun school was based primarily on Yogācāra philosophy 瑜伽行派, particularly theories of the ālayavijn~āna 阿賴耶識. The northern branch of the school, represented by Bodhiruci's student Daochong 道寵, took the position that the storehouse consciousness is not real, and that buddha-nature is first acquired on attaining buddhahood, thus it is not inborn. The southern school, represented by Ratnamati's student Huiguang 慧光, saw the ālayavijn~āna as real and identical with the inborn buddha-nature 佛性. The Huayan school 華嚴宗 is said to have developed out of the southern branch, while Faxiang 法相宗 absorbed the northern branch.	[EngBuddhist]

Hīnayāna, which is undoubtedly nearer to the original teaching of the Buddha, is unfairly described as an endeavour to seek nirvana through an ash-covered body, an extinguished intellect, and solitariness; its followers are sravakas and pratyekabuddhas (i.e. those who are striving for their own deliverance through ascetic works). Mahāyāna, on the other hand, is described as seeking to find and extend all knowledge, and, in certain schools, to lead all to Buddhahood. It has a conception of an Eternal Buddha, or Buddhahood as Eternal (Adi-Buddha), but its especial doctrines are, inter alia, (a) the bodhisattvas 菩薩 , i.e. beings who deny themselves final Nirvana until, according to their vows, they have first saved all the living; (b) salvation by faith in, or invocation of the Buddhas or bodhisattvas; (c) Paradise as a nirvana of bliss in the company of Buddhas, bodhisattvas, saints, and believers. Hīnayāna is sometimes described as 自利 self-benefiting, and Mahāyāna as 自利利他 self-benefit for the benefit of others, unlimited altruism and pity being the theory of Mahāyāna. There is a further division into one-yana and three-yanas: the trīyāna may be śrāvaka, pratyeka-buddha, and bodhisattva, represented by a goat, deer, or bullock cart; the one-yāna is that represented by the Lotus School as the one doctrine of the Buddha, which had been variously taught by him according to the capacity of his hearers, v. 方便. Though Mahāyāna tendencies are seen in later forms of the older Buddhism, the foundation of Mahāyāna has been attributed to Nāgārjuna 龍樹. "The characteristics of this system are an excess of transcendental speculation tending to abstract nihilism, and the substitution of fanciful degrees of meditation and contemplation (v. Samādhi and Dhyāna) in place of the practical asceticism of the Hīnayāna school."[Eitel 68-9.] Two of its foundation books are the 起信論and the 妙法蓮華經 but a larnge numberof Mahāyāna sutras are ascribed to the Buddha。.

"Great vehicle." A translation of the Sanskrit term mahāyāna, the name attached to a late Indian sectarian movement which was to become extremely influential later in East Asia. The term was developed together with the disparaging hīnayāna 小乘, which was used by the former group to distinguish the two. In the polemical sense, the concept of "great vehicle" is intended to refer to the fact that the group considered their doctrines to be more open and universalistic in terms of advocating that enlightenment was something which was attainable by all sentient beings, rather than just by monks and nuns who practiced in the pure environment of the monastery. The Mahāyāna movement produced a large body of new sutras, in which their new model practitioner, the bodhisattva 菩薩, preached the doctrine of the emptiness 空 of all things. The schools which considered themselves to be Mahāyāna (Mādhyamika 中觀派, Yogācāra 瑜伽行派, etc.) were to predominate in the transmission to East Asia, and therefore the later schools which were formed in East Asia also considered themselves as heir to the Mahāyāna teachings.

Explanatory tantra based on the second and third sections of the Tattvasaṃgraha (T 882).

The Awakening of Mahāyāna Faith, attributed to Aśvaghoṣa; T 1665.32.575b-583b.One of the most important texts of the emerging indigenous East Asian Mahāyāna tradition. Written from the perspective of essence and function (tiyong 體用), this text sought to harmonize the two Indian-derived soteriological positions of the tathāgatagarbha and ālayavijn~āna systems into a synthetic vision based on the One Mind in Two Aspects. The Awakening of Faith was to become one of the singlemost influential texts in the development of the East Asian style of Buddha-nature theory. It was studied and commented on repeatedly by a long list of East Asian scholars, including such luminaries as Wonhyo 元曉, Fazang 法藏 and Zongmi 宗密. Although its authorship is attributed to the Indian monk Aśvaghoṣa 馬鳴, modern scholarship is fairly certain that the text was an indigenous East Asian production. In great part due to the commentaries by Wonhyo 元曉, the Awakening of Faith ended up having an unusually powerful influence in Korea, where it may be the most oft-cited text in the entire tradition.

(1) Great compassion; great pity (mahā-karuṇā). 〔法華經 T 262.9.23b26〕(2) The great compassion differs from ordinary compassion in eight ways, which are explained in the Mahāvibhāṣā-śāstra. (1) With respect to its nature (自性異) , ordinary compassion is absence of hatred, whereas the great compassion is absence of ignorance. (2) With respect to its aspect (行相異), ordinary compassion takes on the form of one suffering, the ordinary suffering, whereas the great compassion takes on the form of threefold suffering. (3) With respect to its object (所緣異), ordinary compassion is concerned with the beings of one kāma-dhātu 欲界 only, whereas the great compassion is concerned with the three dhātus 三界. (4) With respect to its sphere (bhūmi) (依地異) , ordinary compassion is of the sphere of the ten dhyānas: the four dhyānas, the four stages cross to the four dhyānas, middle and the kāma-bhūmi, whereas the great compassion is of the sphere of the fourth dhyāna only. (5) With respect to its support (依身異) , ordinary compassion arises in śrāvakas, pratyekabuddhas, buddhas as well as sentient beings (pṛthagjanas), whereas the great compassion arises only in the Buddha. (6) With respect to its acquisition (證得異), ordinary compassion is obtained through detachment from kāma-dhātu and the third dhyāna, whereas the great compassion is obtained through detachment from bhavagra only. (7) With respect to its saving (others) (救濟異), ordinary compassion only gives rise to the sympathy for the act of saving (others), whereas the great compassion gives rise to the sympathy and accomplishes the act of saving. (8) With respect to compassion (哀愍異), ordinary compassion is an unequal compassion, for it sympathizes only with beings who are suffering, whereas the great compassion is an equal compassion, turned towards beings equally. 〔大毗婆沙論卷三十一、卷八十三、俱舍論卷二十七〕	[EngBuddhist]

The great all-embracing receiver―a title of a Buddha, especially Amitābha.	[Soothill]
The great teaching. (1) That of the Buddha. (2) Tantrayāna. The mahātantra, yoga, yogacarya, or tantra school which claims Samantabhadra as its founder. It aims at ecstatic union of the individual soul with the world soul, Iśvara. From this result the eight great powers of Siddhi (aṣṭa-mahāsiddhi), namely, ability to (1) make one's body lighter (laghiman); (2) heavier (gaiman); (3) smaller (aṇiman); (4) larger (mahiman) than anything in the world ; (5) reach any place (prāpti) ; (6) assume any shape (prākāmya) ; (7) control all natural laws (īśitva) ; (8) make everything depend upon oneself; all at will (v.如意身 and 神足). By means of mystic formulas (Tantras or dhāraṇīs), or spells (mantras), accompanied by music and manipulation of the hands (mūdra), a state of mental fixity characterized neither by thought nor the annihilation of thought, can be reached. This consists of six-fold bodily and mental happiness (yoga), and from this results power to work miracles. Asaṅga compiled his mystic doctrines circa A.D. 500. The system was introduced into China A.D. 647 by Xuanzang's translation of the Yogācārya-bhūmi-śāstra 瑜伽師地論 ; v. 瑜. On the basis of this, Amoghavajra established the Chinese branch of the school A.D. 720 ; v. 阿目. This was popularized by the labours of Vajrabodhi A.D. 732 ; v. 金剛智.	[Soothill]

mahāvaipulya ; cf. 大方等 The great Vaipulyas, or sutras of Mahāyāna. 方廣 and 方等 are similar in meaning. Vaipulya is extension, spaciousness, widespread, and this is the idea expressed both in 廣 broad, widespread, as opposed to narrow, restricted, and in 等 levelled up, equal everywhere, universal. These terms suggest the broadening of the basis of Buddhism, as is found in Mahāyāna. The Vaipulya works are styled sutras, for the broad doctrine of universalism, very different from the traditional account of his discourses, is put into the mouth of the Buddha in wider, or universal aspect. These sutras are those of universalism, of which the Lotus 法華 is an outstanding example. The form Vaitulya instead of Vaipulya is found in some Kashgar MSS. of the Lotus, suggesting that in the Vetulla sect lies the origin of the Vaipulyas, and with them of Mahāyāna, but the evidence is inadequate.	[Soothill]

(vaipulya, mahā-vaipulya). 'Great and broad.' (1) A term for the true principle awakened to by the Buddha. In some Huayan interpretations, 大 means essence, 方 means aspects, and 廣 refers to function. (2) The great vaipulyas or sutras of Mahāyāna. Vaipulya is extension, spaciousness, widespread. This term suggests the broadening of the basis of Buddhism, as found in Mahāyāna. The vaipulya works are styled sutras, as the broad doctrine of universalism, differing from the traditional account of his discourses, is put into the mouth of the Buddha in a more universal aspect. (3) In the introduction to his commentary to the Sutra of Perfect Enlightenment 圓覺經, Kihwa 己和 devotes much energy to the explanation of this word, explaining da 大 to mean initial enlightenment, fang 方 to mean corrective practices with which one's enlightenment is enhanced and guang 廣 as the compassionate extension of one's enlightenment to others.

Vairocana, or Mahāvairocana 大日如來; 遍照如來; 摩訶毘盧遮那； 毘盧遮那; 大日覺王 The sun, "shining everywhere" The chief object of worship of the Shingon sect in Japan, "represented by the gigantic image in the temple at Nara." (Eliot.) There he is known as Dai-nichi-nyorai. He is counted as the first, and according to some, the origin of the five celestial Buddhas (dhyāni-buddhas, or jinas). He dwells quiescent in Arūpa-dhātu, the Heaven beyond form, and is the essence of wisdom (bodhi) and of absolute purity. Samantabhadra 普賢 is his dhyāni-bodhisattva. The 大日經 "teaches that Vairocana is the whole world, which is divided into Garbhadhātu (material) and Vajradhātu (indestructible), the two together forming Dharmadhātu. The manifestations of Vairocana's body to himself―that is, Buddhas and Bodhisattvas ―are represented symbolically by diagrams of several circles ". Eliot. In the 金剛界 or vajradhātu maṇḍala he is the center of the five groups. In the 胎藏界 or Garbhadhātu he is the center of the eight-leaf (lotus) court. His appearance, symbols, esoteric word, differ according to the two above distinctions. Generally he is considered as an embodiment of the Truth 法, both in the sense of dharmakāya 法身 and dharmaratna 法寶. Some hold Vairocana to be the dharmakāya of Śākyamuni 大日與釋迦同一佛 but the esoteric school denies this identity. Also known as 最高顯廣眼藏如來, the Tathagata who, in the highest, reveals the far-reaching treasure of his eye, i.e. the sun. 大日大聖不動明王 is described as one of his transformations. Also, a śramaņa of Kashmir (contemporary of Padma-saṃbhava); he is credited with introducing Buddhism into Khotan and being an incarnation of Mañjuśrī; the king Vijaya Saṃbhava built a monastery for him.

A meeting for the worship of Vairocana.	[Soothill]
Mahāvairocana, the Buddha who is the central teacher and object of veneration in Vajrayāna Buddhism 密宗. "The Great Sun Buddha, is the transcendent and cosmocratic apotheosis of the historical Buddha, Sakyamuni. Under the earlier designation Vairocana ("the luminous one"), he represents Buddhism's most profound speculation on the emptiness and interpenetration of all elements in the universe (dharmadhātu). As Mahāvairocana he is concretely envisaged as the all-encompassing lord of the cosmos and is the object of worship for a form of Tantric Buddhism that spread from India to Sumatra, China, Japan, and Tibet." (Encyclopedia of Religion, Orzech). Originally the name referred to the light of the sun, but later on took on connotations of the buddha as fundamental principle of the universe. He is one of the five buddhas 五佛 depicted in the maṇḍalas of the vajradhātu and garbhadhātu. The name is transcribed into Chinese as 摩訶毗盧遮那 and 毗盧遮那佛, and is translated variously as 最高顯廣眼藏, 遍照王如來, 光明遍照, 大日遍照, 遍一切處, 遍照尊.	[EngBuddhist]

Notwithstanding this, the Saddharma-puṇḍarīka calls Brahma 'the father of all living beings'" 一切眾生之父. Mahābrahman is the unborn or uncreated ruler over all, especially according to Buddhism over all the heavens of form, i.e. of mortality. He rules over these heavens, which are of threefold form: (a) Brahma (lord), (b) Brahma-purohitas (ministers), and (c) Brahma-pāriṣadyāh (people). His heavens are also known as the middle dhyāna heavens, i.e. between the first and second dhyānas. He is often represented on the right of the Buddha. According to Chinese accounts the Hindus speak of him (1) as born of Nārāyaṇa, from Brahma's mouth sprang the brahmans, from his arms the kṣatriyas, from his thighs the vaiśyas, and from his feet the śūdras; (2) as born from Viṣṇu; (3) as a trimūrti, evidently that of Brahma, Viṣṇu, and Śiva, but Buddhists define Mahābrahma's dharmakāya as Maheśvara (Śiva), his saṃbhogakāya as Nārāyaṇa, and his nirmāṇakāya as Brahmā.

The primary theme of this work, which is of utmost importance in East Asian esotericism, is the realization of the mind seeking enlightenment 菩提心. This theme is addressed in the opening dialogue between Mahāvairocana 大日如來 and an assembly led by Vajrapāṇi 執金剛秘密主, who inquires about omniscient knowledge (sarvajn~ājn~āna 一切智智). The Bhagavan responds that "it is caused by the mind which seeks enlightenment, is founded on sympathy for others, and culminates in skilful methods" (karuṇāmūlaṃ bodhicittahetukam upāyaparyavasānam 悲為根本。菩提心為因。方便為究竟). Enlightenment is defined as "knowing one's mind for what it really is" 謂如實知自心, and subsequent chapters are devoted to describing the skilful methods 方便 for its accomplishment. Foremost among these methods is entrance into the maṇḍala born from great compassion (mahākaruṇāgarbhodbhava-maṇḍala 大悲胎藏生曼荼羅), described at length in chapter two, The Relevant Equipment 具緣品.' Later chapters deal with the entire gamut of esoteric techniques: the practice of mantras 真言, the fire ceremony (homa 護摩), the wheel of syllables (akṣāracakra 字輪), meditation on the stūpa of five cakras 五輪塔, and so on. However, unlike many previous esoteric works, in this text such techniques are almost exclusively oriented towards the accomplishment (siddhi 成就) of enlightenment rather than worldly goals. Many early sources for these esoteric practices have been established: for example, the three-family (kula 部) system can be found in the Dhāraṇīsamuccaya 陀羅尼集經, and its maṇḍala is indebted to the Vajrapāṇyabhiṣeka-tantra 金剛手灌頂續 (To.496). It is likely that the original text was composed in the mid-seventh century CE, when esotericism gained the status of legitimate "hot topic" among Buddhist monastics in India. while a Sanskrit version has never been found, fragments have been located in diverse sources: the Kriyāsaṃgraha (To.2531), the Indonesian Sang Hyang Kamahāyānan Mantranaya, the Bhāvanākrama, and the Pradīpoddyotana.##The Chinese text is based on a manuscript recovered from the belongings of the pilgrim Wuxing 無行 (d.674), which, as with many tantras, is said to have been a condensed version (laghutantra 略本) abridged from a lengthy original (mūlatantra 廣本) of 100,000 verses 迦陀.##An ambitious attempt at reconstructing the Sanskrit was made by Jiun 慈雲 (1718-1804), who made use of citations in the principal Chinese commentary, the Darijingshu 大日經疏 (T.1796). This exhaustive and accessible commentary, along with a well-maintained ritual tradition, have contributed greatly to the text's continuing importance in the Japanese esoteric schools. By contrast, it seems to have attracted little attention in Tibet, where it was translated no later than the early ninth century by Śīlendrabodhi and dPal-brtegs. Lucid and generous commentaries by the eighth-century pandit Buddhaguhya 佛密 (Sangs-rgyas-gsang-ba), such as the Vairocana-abhisambodhitantrapiṇḍartha (To.2662, P.3486), were also translated into Tibetan. For scholastics such as mKhas-grub-rje 智法祖師 (1385-1438) the text's most noteworthy feature is its advocacy of a yoga without semiosis (animittayoga 無相三昧, mtshan ma med pa'i rnal byor), a practice which qualifies its preeminent rank among the cārya 行 tantras in the Tibetan classification. The sequence of chapters in the Chinese and Tibetan editions differs slightly, suggesting that in later times chapters were reordered in accordance with exegetical tradition. Correspondences between chapter numbers are as follows: 1-5:1-5, 6+7:6, 8-12:10-14, 13:16, 14:15, 15-26:17-28, 27+31:29, 28-30:7-9. The seventh fascicle of the Chinese version is a ritualisation of the entire text, apparently composed later than the preceding chapters and circulated as a separate work in India. This short ritual text, the Mahāvairocana-abhisaṃbodhisambaddhapūjāvidhi, was also translated by Vajrabodhi 金剛智 as the Abridged Recitation Sūtra 要略念誦經 (T.849). For a preliminary English translation of the whole text, see Chikyo Yamamoto, Mahāvairocanasūtra, Satapiṭaka series 359, 1990.	[EngBuddhist]

Commentary on the first 31 chapters (6 fasc.) of the Vairocana-abhisaṃbodhi-tantra 大日經 (T 848). The fascicle numbers of the original and the commentary correspond as follows: 1:1-8, 2:9-10, 3:19:13, 4:12-13, 5:14-17, 6:18-20. Partially based on lectures given by Śubhākarasi?ha 善無畏 at the time of its translation. A great many Sanskrit terms and their Chinese equivalents are described in detail, and Yixing supports doctrinal points with citations from a plethora of Chinese Mahāyāna texts -- occasionally adding insights from his experience with the Tattvasaṃgraha system (T 866). These informed references to existing traditions, together with the natural authority of Śubhākarasi?ha's comments, contributed greatly to the successful adoption of the Vairocana-abhisaṃbodhi-tantra in East Asia.##(An abridged version, the Dainichikyō gishaku 大日經義釋 (Z.36.507ff), was circulated by Yixing's associates after his death.) Kūkai 空海 frequently quotes Yixing's full commentary in his writings; he was the first to bring it to Japan, where sub-commentaries were written by Saisen 濟暹 (T 2215), Raiyu 賴瑜 (T 2217), Yūhan 宥範 (T 2213), Shōken 聖憲 (T 2539), Yūkai 宥快 (T 2218) and Donjaku 曇寂 (T 2219); of these, the latter two are perhaps the most helpful.

摩調僧祇部 Mahāsāṅghikāḥ, the school of the community, or majority; one of the chief early divisions, cf. 上坐部 Mahāsthavirāḥ or Sthavirāḥ, i.e. the elders. There are two usages of the term, first, when the sthavira, or older disciples assembled in the cave after the Buddha's death, and the others, the 大眾, assembled outside. As sects, the principal division was that which took place later. The Chinese attribute this division to the influence of 大天 Mahādeva, a century after the Nirvāṇa, and its subsequent five subdivisions are also associated with his name: they are Pūrvasailāḥ, Avaraśailāḥ, Haimavatāḥ, Lokottara-vādinaḥ, and Prajñapti-vādinaḥ; v. 小乘.

Maheśvara, 摩醯首濕伐羅 or Śiva, lord of the present chiliocosm, or universe; he is described under two forms, one as the prince of demons, the other as divine, i.e. 毘舍闍 Piśācamaheśvara and 淨居 Śuddhāvāsa- or Śuddhodanamaheśvara. As Piśāca, head of the demons, he is represented with three eyes and eight arms, and riding on a white bull; a bull or a linga being his symbol. The esoteric school takes him for the transformation body of Vairocana, and as appearing in many forms, e.g. Viṣṇu, Nārāyana (i.e. Brahmā), etc. His wife (śakti) is Bhīmā, or 大自在天婦. As Śuddhāvāsa, or Pure dwelling, he is described as a bodhisattva of the tenth or highest degree, on the point of entering Buddhahood. There is dispute as to whether both are the same being, or entirely different. The term also means the sixth or highest of the six desire heavens.	[Soothill]

mahāparinirvāṇa, explained by 大入滅息 the great, or final entrance into extinction and cessation; or 大圓寂入 great entrance into perfect rest; 大滅度 great extinction and passing over (from mortality). It is interpreted in Mahāyāna as meaning the cessation or extinction of passion and delusion, of mortality, and of all activities, and deliverance into a state beyond these concepts. In Mahāyāna it is not understood as the annihilation, or cessation of existence; the reappearance of Dīpaṃkara 然燈 (who had long entered nirvāṇa) along with Śākyamuni on the Vulture Peak supports this view. It is a state above all terms of human expression. See the Lotus Sutra and the Nirvāṇa sūtra.	[Soothill]

It consists of 600 juan as translated by Xuanzang. Parts of it were translated by others under various titles and considerable differences are found in them. It is the fundamental philosophical work of the Mahāyāna school, the formulation of wisdom, which is the sixth pāramitā.	[Soothill]

Mahā-prajn~ā-pāramitā-sūtra. 600 fascicles, T 220.5-7. A collection of sixteen sutras, short and long, which articulate the doctrine of prajn~āpāramitā. Translated by Xuanzang from 660-663. This massive work, filling three entire Taishō volumes, includes such well known works as the Heart Sutra 心經 and Diamond Sutra 金剛經, and is one of the most complete collections of Prajn~āpāramitā sutras available. Xuanzang 玄奘 considered abridging his translation to avoid repetition, but was dissuaded by a dream, and thus translated the Prajn~āpāramitā corpus in toto. Edward Conze has translated many different portions of this corpus, in Conze (1973), Conze (1975) and Conze (1993). Though taken from the Sanskrit, not Chinese versions of these texts, provides a sampling of their style and content.	[EngBuddhist]

The brunt of the Ratnakūṭa was translated by Bodhiruci (706) and Dharmarakṣa (313), though many other translators contributed selections. According to Xuanzang's biography, the last text he was asked to translate was the complete Ratnakūta. He began, but sickness and old age prevented him from getting very far. Since the Ta p'u-sa tsang ching was the first text he translated upon returning to China, that brought his work full circle.	[EngBuddhist]

Mahākāla 摩訶迦 (or 謌) 羅 the great black deva 大黑神. Two interpretations are given. The esoteric cult describes the deva as the masculine form of Kālī, i.e. Durgā, the wife of Śiva; with one face and eight arms, or three faces and six arms, a necklace of skulls, etc. He is worshipped as giving warlike power, and fierceness; said also to be an incarnation of Vairocana for the purpose of destroying the demons; and is described as 大時 the "great time"　(-keeper) which seems to indicate Vairocana, the sun. The exoteric cult interprets him as a beneficent deva, a Pluto, or god of wealth. Consequently he is represented in two forms, by the one school as a fierce deva, by the other as a kindly happy deva. He is shown as one of the eight fierce guardians with trident, generally blue-black but sometimes white; he may have two elephants underfoot. Six arms and hands hold jewel, skull cup, chopper, drum, trident, elephant-goad. He is the tutelary god of Mongolian Buddhism.

Studying under 慧思 Huici of Hunan, he was greatly influenced by his teaching; and found in the Lotus Sutra the real interpretation of Mahayanism. In 575 he first came to Tiantai and established his school, which in turn was the foundation of important Buddhist schools in Korea and Japan.	[Soothill]
The Tiantai, or Tendai, sect founded by 智顗 Zhiyi. It bases its tenets on the Lotus Sutra 法華經 with the 智度論, 涅盤經, and 大品經; it maintains the identity of the Absolute and the world of phenomena, and attempts to unlock the secrets of all phenomena by means of meditation. It flourished during the Tang dynasty. Under the Sung, when the school was decadent, arose 四明 Ciming, under whom there came the division of 山家 Hill or Tiantai School and 山外 the School outside, the latter following 悟恩 Wuen and in time dying out; the former, a more profound school, adhered to Ciming; it was from this school that the Tiantai doctrine spread to Japan. The three principal works of the Tiantai founder are called 天台三部, i. e. 玄義 exposition of the deeper meaning of the Lotus; 文句 exposition of its text; and 止觀 meditation; the last was directive and practical; it was in the line of Bodhidharma, stressing the 'inner light'.	[Soothill]

ntai zong; one of the thirteen schools of Buddhism in China 十三宗, and Japan. Also called the "Lotus Sutra School" 法華宗.##(1) China: A Mahāyāna school established by Zhiyi 智顗 of Tiantai mountain. Zhiyi, taking the Lotus Sutra 法華經 as his basis, classified the other Buddhist sutras into five periods 五時 and eight types of teachings; he discussed the theory of perfect interpenetration of the triple truth 三諦 and taught the rapid attainment of Buddhahood through the practice of observing the mind. The Chinese line of transmission starts with Huiwen 慧文 of the Northern Chi and follows with Huisi 慧思. Next Zhiyi explained the three great scriptures of the school 法華三部 emphasizing both scriptural study and practice. The sixth patriarch, Jingqi 荊溪 also popularized the sect through his commentaries on these three scriptures.##(2) Korea: Tiantai was introduced to Korea as Ch'ont'ae a couple of times during earlier periods, but was not firmly established until the time of Uich'on 義天 (1055-1101) who established Ch'ont'ae in the Koryo as an independent sect. Due to Uich'on's influence, it came to be a major force in the world of Koryo Buddhism. After he returned from Song China in 1086, Uich'on sought to ease conflict between the doctrinal 教 schools and Son 禪 schools, believing that the Ch'ont'ae doctrine would be effective to this end. Ch'ont'ae would eventually die out in Korea, its teachings being absorbed into the Chogye Son 曹溪tradition.##(3) Japan: The Tiantai teaching was brought to Japan by Jianshen 鑒真 in the middle of the 8th century, but it was not widely accepted. In 805, Saichō 最澄 brought back the Tendai teachings from China and made the temple that he had built on Mt. Hiei 比睿山, the Enryakuji, a center for the study and practice of Tendai. However, what he had transmitted from China was not exclusively Tendai, but also included Zen 禪, Esoteric 密教 and Monastic Discipline 戒律 teachings. This tendency became more marked in the doctrines of his successors, such as Ennin 圓仁 and Enchin 圓珍. The Tendai sect flourished under the patronage of the imperial family and nobility in Japan.

His resolve, however, had proved effective, for the master of the ass beat her so hard that she dropped her foal dead. Thus Indra returned to his former existence and began his ascent to Buddha.

Hīnayāna 希那衍. The small, or inferior wain, or vehicle; the form of Buddhism which developed after Śākyamuni's death to about the beginning of the Christian era, when Mahāyāna doctrines were introduced. It is the orthodox school and more in direct line with the Buddhist succession than Mahāyānism which developed on lines fundamentally different. The Buddha was a spiritual doctor, less interested in philosophy than in the remedy for human misery and perpetual transmigration. He "turned aside from idle metaphysical speculations; if he held views on such topics, he deemed them valueless for the purposes of salvation, which was his goal" (Keith). Metaphysical speculations arose after his death, and naturally developed into a variety of Hīnayāna schools before and after the separation of a distinct school of Mahāyāna. Hīnayāna remains the form in Ceylon, Burma, and Siam, hence is known as Southern Buddhism in contrast with Northern Buddhism or Mahāyāna, the form chiefly prevalent from Nepal to Japan. Another rough division is that of Pali and Sanskrit, Pali being the general literary language of the surviving form of Hīnayāna, Sanskrit of Mahāyāna. The term Hīnayāna is of Mahāyānist origination to emphasize the universalism and altruism of Mahāyāna over the narrower personal salvation of its rival. According to Mahāyāna teaching its own aim is universal Buddhahood, which means the utmost development of wisdom and the perfect transformation of all the living in the future state; it declares that Hīnayāna, aiming at arhatship and pratyekabuddhahood, seeks the destruction of body and mind and extinction in nirvāṇa. For arhatship the 四諦Four Noble Truths are the foundation teaching, for pratyekabuddhahood the 十二因緣 twelve-nidānas, and these two are therefore sometimes styled the two vehicles 二乘. Tiantai sometimes calls them the (Hīnayāna) Tripiṭaka school. Three of the eighteen Hīnayāna schools were transported to China: 俱舍 (Abhidharma) Kośa; 成實 Satya-siddhi; and the school of Harivarman, the律 Vinaya school. These are described by Mahāyānists as the Buddha's adaptable way of meeting the questions and capacity of his hearers, though his own mind is spoken of as always being in the absolute Mahāyāna all-embracing realm. Such　is the Mahāyāna view of Hīnayāna, and if the Vaipulya sūtras and special scriptures of their school, which are repudiated by Hīnayāna, are apocryphal, of which there seems no doubt, then Mahāyāna in condemning Hīnayāna must find other support for its claim to orthodoxy. The sūtras on which it chiefly relies, as regards the Buddha, have no authenticity; while those of Hīnayāna cannot be accepted as his veritable teaching in the absence of fundamental research. Hīnayāna is said to have first been divided into minority and majority sections immediately after the death of Śākyamuni, when the sthāvira, or older disciples, remained in what is spoken of as "the cave", some place at Rājagṛha, to settle the future of the order, and the general body of disciples remained outside; these two are the first 上坐部 and 大眾部 q. v. The first doctrinal division is reported to have taken place under the leadership of the monk 大天 Mahādeva (q.v.) a hundred years after the Buddha's nirvāṇa and during the reign of Aśoka; his reign, however, has been placed later than this by historians. Mahādeva's sect became the Mahāsāṅghikā, the other the Sthāvira. In time the two are said to have divided into eighteen, which with the two originals are the so-called "twenty sects" of Hīnayāna. Another division of four sects, referred to by Yijing, is that of the 大眾部 (Arya) Mahāsaṅghanikāya, 上座部 Āryasthavirāḥ, 根本說一切有部 Mūlasarvāstivādaḥ, and 正量部 Saṃmatīyāḥ. There is still another division of five sects, 五部律. For the eighteen Hīnayāna sects see 小乘十八部.	[Soothill]

A Chinese list of the "eighteen" sects of the Hīnayāna, omitting Mahāsāṅghikāḥ, Sthavira, and Sarvāstivādah as generic schools: I. 大眾部 The Mahāsāṅghikāḥ is divided into eight schools as follows: (1) 一說部 Ekavyavahārikāḥ; (2) 說出世部 Lokottaravādinaḥ; (3) 雞胤部 Kaukkuṭikāḥ (Gokulikā); (4) 多聞部 Bahuśrutīyāḥ; (5) 說假部 Prajñāptivadinaḥ; (6) 制多山部 Jetavaniyāḥ, or Caityaśailāḥ; (7) 西山住部 Aparaśailāḥ; (8) 北山住部 Uttaraśailāḥ. II. 上坐部 Āryasthavirāḥ, or Sthāviravādin, divided into eight schools: (1) 雪山部 Haimavatāḥ. The 說一切有部 Sarvāstivādaḥ gave rise to (2) 犢子部 Vātsīputrīyāḥ, which gave rise to (3) 法上部 Dharmottarīyāḥ; (4) 賢冑部 Bhadrayānīyāḥ; (5) 正量部 Saṃmatīyāḥ; and (6) 密林山 Saṇṇagarikāḥ; (7) 化地部 Mahīśāsakāḥ produced (8) 法藏部 Dharmaguptāḥ.

The 金光明經 makes all revelations of Buddha as Buddha to be 應身; while all incarnations not as Buddha, but in the form of any of the five paths of existence, are Buddha's 化身. Tiantai has the distinction of 勝應身 and 劣應身, i.e. superior and inferior nirmāṇakāya, or supernatural and natural.	[Soothill]

(文殊師利) Mañjuśrī 滿殊尸利 -later 曼殊室利. 文殊 is also used for Mañjunātha, Mañjudeva, Mañjughoṣa, Mañjuṣvara, et al. T., hjamdpal; J., Monju. Origin unknown; presumably, like most Buddhas and bodhisattvas, an idealization of a particular quality, in his case of Wisdom. Mañju is beautiful, Śrī; good fortune, virtue, majesty, lord, an epithet of a god. Six definitions are obtained from various scriptures: 妙首 (or 頭 ) wonderful or beautiful) head; 普首 universal head; 濡首 glossy head (probably a transliteration); 敬首 revered head; 妙德 wonderful virtue (or power); 妙吉祥 wonderfully auspicious; the last is a later translation in the 西域記. As guardian of wisdom 智慧 he is often placed on Śākyamuni's left, with 普顯 on the right as guardian of law 理, the latter holding the Law, the former the wisdom or exposition of it; formerly they held the reverse positions. He is often represented with five curls or waves to his hair indicating the 五智 q. v. or the five peaks; his hand holds the sword of wisdom and he sits on a lion emblematic of its stern majesty: but he has other forms. He is represented as a youth, i. e. eternal youth. His present abode is given as east of the universe, known as 清涼山 clear and cool mountain, or a region 寶住 precious abode, or Abode of Treasures, or 寶氏 from which he derives one of his titles, 寶相如來. One of his dhāraṇīs prophesies China as his post-nirvāṇa realm. In past incarnations he is described as being the parent of many Buddhas and as having assisted the Buddha into existence; his title was 龍種上佛 the supreme Buddha of the nāgas, also 大身佛 or 神仙佛; now his title is 歡喜藏摩尼寶精佛 The spiritual Buddha who joyfully cares for the jewel: and his future title is to be 普現佛 Buddha universally revealed. In the 序品 Introductory Chapter of the Lotus Sutra he is also described as the ninth predecessor or Buddha-ancestor of Śākyamuni. He is looked on as the chief of the Bodhisattvas and represents them, as the chief disciple of the Buddha, or as his son 法王子. Hīnayāna counts Śāriputra as the wisest of the disciples, Mahāyāna gives Mañjuśrī the chief place, hence he is also styled 覺母 mother, or begetter of understanding. He is shown riding on either a lion or a peacock, or sitting on a white lotus; often he holds a book, emblem of wisdom, or a blue lotus; in certain rooms of a monastery he is shown as a monk; and he appears in military array as defender of the faith. His signs, magic words, and so on, are found in various sutras. His most famous centre in China is Wu-tai shan in Shansi. where he is the object of pilgrimages, especially of Mongols. The legends about him are many. He takes the place in Buddhism of Viśvakarman as Vulcan, or architect, of the universe. He is one of the eight Dhyāni-bodhisattvas, and sometimes has the image of Akṣobhya in his crown. He was mentioned in China as early as the fourth century and in the Lotus Sutra he frequently appears, especially as the converter of the daughter of the Dragon-king of the Ocean. He has five messengers 五使者 and eight youths 八童子 attending on him. His hall in the Garbhadhātu maṇḍala is the seventh, in which his group numbers twenty-five. His position is northeast. There are numerous sutras and other works with his name as title, e. g. 文殊師利問菩提經 Gayaśīrṣa sūtra, tr. by Kumārajīva 384-417: and its 論 or .Tīkā of Vasubandhu, tr. by Bodhiruci 535. see list in B. N.

An abbot, 寺主 head of a monastery; the term is said to arise from the ten-foot cubic dwelling in which 維摩 Vimalakirti lived, but here seems to be no Sanskrit equivalent.	[Soothill]
upāya. Convenient to the place, or situation, suited to the condition, opportune, appropriate; but 方 is interpreted as 方法 method, mode, plan, and 便 as 便用 convenient for use, i. e. a convenient or expedient method; also 方 as 方正 and 便 as 巧妙, which implies strategically correct. It is also intp. as 權道智 partial, temporary, or relative (teaching of) knowledge of reality, in contrast with 般若智 prajñā, and 真實 absolute truth, or reality instead of the seeming. The term is a translation of 傴和 upāya, a mode of approach, an expedient, stratagem, device. The meaning is— teaching according to the capacity of the hearer, by any suitable method, including that of device or stratagem, but expedience beneficial to the recipient is understood. Mahāyāna claims that the Buddha used this expedient or partial method in his teaching until near the end of his days, when he enlarged it to the revelation of reality, or the preaching of his final and complete truth; Hīnayāna with reason denies this, and it is evident that the Mahāyāna claim has no foundation, for the whole of its 方等 or 方廣 scriptures are of later invention. Tiantai speaks of the 三乘 q. v. or Three Vehicles as 方便 expedient or partial revelations, and of its 一乘 or One Vehicle as the complete revelation of universal Buddhahood. This is the teaching of the Lotus Sutra, which itself contains 方便 teaching to lead up to the full revelation; hence the terms 體内 (or 同體 ) 方便, i. e. expedient or partial truths within the full revelation, meaning the expedient part of the Lotus, and 體外方便 the expedient or partial truths of the teaching which preceded the Lotus; see the 方便品 of that work, also the second chapter of the 維摩經. 方便 is also the seventh of the ten pāramitās.

The term covers the whole of the specifically Mahāyāna sutras. The sutras are also known as 無量義經 scriptures of measureless meaning, i. e. universalistic, or the infinite. Cf. 方等.	[Soothill]

vaipulya; cf. 方廣. 方 is interpreted as referring to the doctrine, 等 as equal, or universal, i. e. everynwhere equally. An attempt is made to distinguish between the two above terms, 方廣 being now used for vaipulya, but they are interchangeable. Eitel says the vaipulya sutras 'are distinguished by an expansion of doctrine and style (Sūtras developées, Burnouf). They are apparently of later date, showing the influence of different schools; their style is diffuse and prolix, repeating the same idea over and over again in prose and in verse; they are also frequently interlarded with prophecies and dhāraṇīs'; but the two terms seem to refer rather to the content than the form. The content is that of universalism. Chinese Buddhists assert that all the sutras from the 華嚴 Huayan onwards are of this class and therefore are Mahāyāna. Consequently all 方等 or 方廣 sutras are claimed by that school. Cf. 方便.	[Soothill]

In the fourteenth year after his enlightenment the Buddha yielded to persuasion and admitted his aunt and women to his order of religious mendicants, but said that the admission of women would shorten the period of Buddhism by 500 years. The nun, however old, must acknowledge the superiority of every monk; must never scold him or tell his faults; must never accuse him, though he may accuse her; and must in all respects obey the rules as commanded by him. She accepts all the rules for the monks with additional rules for her own order. Such is the theory rather than the practice. The title by which Mahāprajāpatī was addressed was applied to nuns, i. e. ārya, or noble, 阿姨, though some consider the Chinese term entirely native.	[Soothill]

nirvāṇa, 'blown out, gone out, put out, extinguished'; 'liberated-from existence'; 'dead, deceased, defunct.' 'Liberation, eternal bliss'; '(with Buddhists and Jainas) absolute extinction or annihilation, complete extinction of individual existence.' M.W. Other forms are 涅槃那; 泥日; 泥洹; 泥畔 Originally translated 滅 to extinguish, extinction, put out (as a lamp or fire), it was also described as 解脫 release, 寂滅 tranquil extinction; 無為 inaction, without effort, passiveness; 不生 no (re)birth; 安樂 calm joy; 滅度transmigration to 'extinction'. The meaning given to 'extinction' varies, e.g. individual extinction; cessation of rebirth; annihilation of passion; extinction of all misery and entry into bliss. While the meaning of individual extinction is not without advocates, the general acceptation is the extinction or end of all return to reincarnation with its concomitant suffering, and the entry into bliss. Nirvāṇa may be enjoyed in the present life as an attainable state, with entry into parinirvāṇa, or perfect bliss to follow. It may be (a) with a 'remainder', i.e. the cause but not all the effect (karma), of reincarnation having been destroyed; (b) without 'remainder', both cause and effect having been extinguished. The answer of the Buddha as to the continued personal existence of the Tathāgata in nirvāṇa is, in the Hīnayāna canon, relegated 'to the sphere of the indeterminates' (Keith), as one of the questions which are not essential to salvation. One argument is that flame when blown out does not perish but returns to the totality of Fire. The Nirvāṇa Sutra claims for nirvāṇa the ancient ideas of 常樂我淨 permanence, bliss, personality purity in the transcendental realm. Mahāyāna declares that Hīnayāna by denying personality in the transcendental realm denies the existence of the Buddha. In Mahāyāna final nirvāṇa is transcendental, and is also used as a term for the absolute. The place where the Buddha entered his earthly nirvāṇa is given as Kuśinagara, cf. 拘.	[Soothill]

Nirvana##Nirvana is a Sanskrit word which is originally translated as "perfect stillness".

(盂蘭); 鳥藍婆 (鳥藍婆拏) ullambana 盂蘭 may be another form of lambana or avalamba, "hanging down," "depending," "support"; it is intp. "to hang upside down", or "to be in suspense", referring to extreme suffering in purgatory; but there is a suggestion of the dependence of the dead on the living. By some 盆 is regarded as a Chinese word, not part of the transliteration, meaning a vessel filled with offerings of food. The term is applied to the festival of All Souls, held about the 15th of the 7th moon, when masses are read by Buddhist and Taoist priests and elaborate offerings made to the Buddhist Trinity for the purpose of releasing from purgatory the souls of those who have died on land or sea. The Ullambanapātra Sutra is attributed to Śākyamuni, of course incorrectly; it was first tr. into Chinese by Dharmaraksha, A.D. 266-313 or 317; the first masses are not reported until the time of Liang Wudi, A.D. 538; and were popularized by Amogha (A.D. 732) under the influence of the Yogācārya School. They are generally observed in China, but are unknown to Southern Buddhism. The "idea of intercession on the part of the priesthood for the benefit of" souls in hell "is utterly antagonistic to the explicit teaching of primitive Buddhism'" The origin of the custom is unknown, but it is foisted on to Śākyamuni, whose disciple Maudgalyāyana is represented as having been to purgatory to relieve his mother's sufferings. Śākyamuni told him that only the united efforts of the whole priesthood 十方眾會 could alleviate the pains of the suffering. The mere suggestion of an All Souls Day with a great national day for the monks is sufficient to account for the spread of the festival. Eitel says: "Engrafted upon the narrative ancestral worship, this ceremonial for feeding the ghost of deceased ancestors of seven generations obtained immense popularity and is now practised by everybody in China, by Taoists even and by Confucianists." All kinds of food offerings are made and paper garments, etc., burnt. The occasion, 7th moon, 15th day, is known as the盂蘭會 (or 盂蘭盆會 or 盂蘭齋 or 盂蘭盆齋) and the sutra as 盂蘭經 (or 盂蘭盆經).	[Soothill]

To level a place for an altar, to sacrifice to the hills and fountains; to abdicate. Adopted by Buddhists for dhyāna, 禪 or 禪那, i.e. meditation, abstraction, trance. dhyāna is 'meditation, thought, reflection, especially profound and abstract religious contemplation'. M.W. It was intp. as 'getting rid of evil', etc., later as 靜慮 quiet meditation. It is a form of 定, but that word is more closely allied with samādhi, cf. 禪定. The term also connotes Buddhism and Buddhist things in general, but has special application to the 禪宗 q.v. It is one of the six pāramitās, cf. 波. There are numerous methods and subjects of meditation. The eighteen brahmalokas are divided into four dhyāna regions 'corresponding to certain frames of mind where individuals might be reborn in strict accordance with their spiritual state'. The first three are the first dhyāna, the second three the second dhyāna, the third three the third dhyāna, and the remaining nine the fourth dhyāna. See Eitel. According to Childers' Pali Dictionary, 'The four jhānas are four stages of mystic meditation, whereby the believer's mind is purged from all earthly emotions, and detached as it were from his body, which remains plunged in a profound trance.' Seated cross-legged, the practiser 'concentrates his mind upon a single thought. Gradually his soul becomes filled with a supernatural ecstasy and serenity', his mind still reasoning: this is the first jhāna. Concentrating his mind on the same subject, he frees it from reasoning, the ecstasy and serenity remaining, which is the second jhāna. Then he divests himself of ecstasy, reaching the third stage of serenity. Lastly, in the fourth stage the mind becomes indifferent to all emotions, being exalted above them and purified. There are differences in the Mahāyāna methods, but similarity of aim.	[Soothill]

The Chan, meditative or intuitional, sect usually said to have been established in China by Bodhidharma, v. 達, the twenty-eighth patriarch, who brought the tradition of the Buddha-mind from India. Cf. 楞 13 Laṅkāvatāra sūtra. This sect, believing in direct enlightenment, disregarded ritual and sūtras and depended upon the inner light and personal influence for the propagation of its tenets, founding itself on the esoteric tradition supposed to have been imparted to Kāśyapa by the Buddha, who indicated his meaning by plucking a flower without further explanation. Kāśyapa smiled in apprehension and is supposed to have passed on this mystic method to the patriarchs. The successor of Bodhidharma was 慧可 Huike, and he was succeeded by 僧璨 Sengcan; 道信 Daoxin; 弘忍 Hongren; 慧能 Huineng, and 神秀 Shenxiu, the sect dividing under the two latter into the southern and northern schools: the southern school became prominent, producing 南嶽 Nanyue and 靑原 Qingyuan, the former succeeded by 馬祖 Mazu, the latter by 石頭 Shitou. From Mazu's school arose the five later schools, v. 禪門.	[Soothill]

The doctrine that all phenomena and the ego have no reality, but are composed of a certain number of skandhas or elements, which disintegrate. The void, the sky, space. The universal, the absolute, complete abstraction without relativity. There are classifications into 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 11, 13, 16, and 18 categories. The doctrine is that all things are compounds, or unstable organisms, possessing no self-essence, i.e. are dependent, or caused, come into existence only to perish. The underlying reality, the principle of eternal relativity, or non-infinity, i.e. śūnya, permeates all phenomena making possible their evolution. From this doctrine the Yogācārya school developed the idea of the permanent reality, which is Essence of Mind, the unknowable noumenon behind all phenomena, the entity void of ideas and phenomena, neither matter nor mind, but the root of both.

The first is sometimes divided into two, that of those within 'the cave', and that of those without, i.e. the intimate disciples, and the greater assembly without; the accounts are conflicting and unreliable. The notable three disciples to whom the first reciting is attributed are Kāśyapa, as presiding elder, Ānanda for the Sūtras and the Abhidharma, and Upāli for the Vinaya; others attribute the Abhidharma to Pūrṇa, or Kāśyapa; but, granted the premises, whatever form their work may have taken, it cannot have been that of the existing Tripiṭaka.

pratyekabuddha 辟支佛; 辟支迦佛; 缽剌翳伽陀 (缽剌翳伽佛陀) In the early translations it was rendered 緣覺, i.e. enlightened through reasoning on the riddle of life, especially as defined in the twelve nidānas. Later it was rendered 獨覺 or individual enlightenment, i.e. one who lives apart from others and attains enlightenment alone, or for himself, in contrast with the altruism of the bodhisattva principle. The term pratyekabuddha is not limited to Buddhists, but is also general for recluses pondering alone over the meaning of life, an illustration being the rhinoceros, which lives in isolation. The non-Buddhist enlightenment is illusion, e.g. from observing the 'flying flowers and falling leaves'; the Buddhist enlightenment arises from pondering over the twelve nidānas. As a degree of saintship it is undefined by early Buddhism, receiving its definition at a later period.	[Soothill]

Garbhadhātu, or Garbhakośa-(dhātu), the womb treasury, the universal source from which all things are produced; the matrix; the embryo; likened to a womb in which all of a child is conceived— its body, mind, etc. It is container and content; it covers and nourishes; and is the source of all supply. It represents the 理性 fundamental nature, both material elements and pure bodhi, or wisdom in essence or purity; 理 being the garbhadhātu as fundamental wisdom, and 智 acquired wisdom or knowledge, the vajradhātu. It also represents the human heart in its innocence or pristine purity, which is considered as the source of all Buddha-pity and moral knowledge. And it indicates that from the central being in the maṇḍala, viz. the Sun as symbol of Vairocana, there issue all the other manifestations of wisdom and power, Buddhas, bodhisattvas, demons, etc. It is 本覺 original intellect, or the static intellectuality, in contrast with 始覺 intellection, the initial or dynamic intellectuality represented in the vajradhātu; hence it is the 因 cause and vajradhātu the 果 effect; though as both are a unity, the reverse may be the rule, the effect being also the cause; it is also likened to 利他 enriching others, as vajradhātu is to 自利 enriching self. Kōbō Daishi, founder of the Yoga or Shingon 真言 School in Japan, adopted the representation of the ideas in maṇḍalas, or diagrams, as the best way of revealing the mystic doctrine to the ignorant. The garbhadhātu is the womb or treasury of all things, the universe; the 理 fundamental principle, the source; its symbols are a triangle on its base, and an open lotus as representing the sun and Vairocana. In Japan this maṇḍala is placed on the east, typifying the rising sun as source, or 理. The vajradhātu is placed west and represents 智 wisdom or knowledge as derived from 理 the underlying principle, but the two are essential one to the other, neither existing apart. The material and spiritual; wisdom-source and intelligence; essence and substance; and similar complementary ideas are thus portrayed; the garbhadhātu may be generally considered as the static and the vajradhātu as the dynamic categories, which are nevertheless a unity. The garbhadhātu is divided into 三部 three sections representing samādhi or quiescence, wisdom-store, and pity-store, or thought, knowledge, pity; one is called the Buddha-section, the others the Vajra and Lotus sections respectively; the three also typify vimokṣa, prajñā, and dharmakāya, or freedom, understanding, and spirituality. There are three heads of these sections, i. e. Vairocana, Vajrapāṇi, and Avalokiteśvara; each has a mother or source, e. g. Vairocana from Buddha's-eye; and each has a 明王 or emanation of protection against evil; also a śakti or female energy; a germ-letter, etc. The diagram of five Buddhas contains also four bodhisattvas, making nine in all, and there are altogether thirteen 大院 or great courts of various types of ideas, of varying numbers, generally spoken of as 414.

enlightenment	[EngBuddhist]
bodhisattva, cf. 菩提薩埵. While the idea is not foreign to Hīnayāna, its extension of meaning is one of the chief marks of Mahāyāna. 'The Bodhisattva is indeed the characteristic feature of the Mahāyāna.' Keith. According to Mahāyāna the Hinayanists, i.e. the śrāvaka and pratyekabuddha, seek their own salvation, while the bodhisattva's aim is the salvation of others and of all. The earlier intp. of bodhisattva was 大道心眾生 all beings with mind for the truth; later it became 大覺有情 conscious beings of or for the great intelligence, or enlightenment. It is also intp. in terms of leadership, heroism, etc. In general it is a Mahayanist seeking Buddhahood, but seeking it altruistically; whether monk or layman, he seeks enlightenment to enlighten others, and he will sacrifice himself to save others; he is devoid of egoism and devoted to helping others. All conscious beings having the Buddha-nature are natural bodhisattvas, but require to undergo development. The mahāsattva is sufficiently advanced to become a Buddha and enter nirvāṇa, but according to his vow he remains in the realm of incarnation to save all conscious beings. A monk should enter on the arduous course of discipline which leads to Bodhisattvahood and Buddhahood.	[Soothill]

But both are one as are Reason and Wisdom, and Vairocana (the illuminator, the 大日 great sun) presides over both, as source and supply.
